R_6Vk9iEzlRhoajKx,EN,Bulgaria,22,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,White/European,Immigrant,6,7,"I live at two locations: Sofia is my hometown, but I study and work in Luxembourg. I have noticed that mostly I feel helpless and anxious in Sofia because generally the standard of living is much lower, from there the attitude and the mentality is different, focused on the lack (survival mode). People are more prone to drawn in their emotions, so I get more care about my feelings by my family and friends there. In Luxembourg, I usually feel more hopeful, more relaxed, my mind is clearer because I don't have to think how to survive, I think how to develop. Surviving is a given, the mode there is improvement. For this reason, people do not show their emotions that often, therfore they don't care that much about other people's feeling either."

The town in live in is quite depressed and there is much lack.  Lack of income, resources, drive to improve self in much of this community along with a lack of resources to do so.  The cost of living is very high in compare to the income people are able to make.  There is a large population of drug and alcohol users as well.  Many would move and yet optional towns are higher cost (as in Stowe) and unattainable for most residents here under these circumstances.  Health in this county gets put on the back burner or often, left by the wayside all together due to the economical issues in this area.  There is a widening path of those broadening their awareness and community which I feel will help exponentially in the future for this area.  Connection is key.  It is also the limiting factor in these times."

However, I'm very lucky to live with my parents right now who are very supportive of me while I try to improve my health. I'm not able to work or study right now which is difficult for me. Trying to understand my relationship with myself and my body in light of my diagnoses has also affected how I'm trying to figure out my sexuality and gender identity. My geographic location has positives and negatives. Living in a rural area is beautiful which is nice for my mental health. Living in Scotland is amazing because my health care costs very little. However, living in a rural area in Scotland makes it difficult to get to all my doctors' appointments, especially since I am not able to drive anymore and my family does not have a car. Being a white American immigrant means that I don't have most of the disadvantages other immigrants face in this country."

I loved it there, and I still consider it my home. However, we got kicked out of our old house that we were renting so we bought a house in Pennsylvania, where everyone we knew was moving to because housing was so cheap. We have lived there for almost three years now and I have never considered York, PA to be my home. I hate it there, it is so urban and loud and messy and I just feel unsafe - I had to finish my high school career doing cyber school because the school in my district was unruly and had metal detectors at every entrance and exit and its own police force and I had my bag inspected every time I entered the building. I did not feel safe. Living in West Virginia for school, where it is quiet and small and rural, I feel much happier and safer. The only reason I like PA is that my family and my dogs are there, nothing else. I have no friends there, and I only have friends that still live in Maryland.

The man I love is a thousand miles away and called my FRIEND cute, I can't express my love because I'm a coward and then I'm surprised when they find someone new, I have abandonment issues when it comes to love, AND I was a gifted kid so I have all of that pent up childhood trauma. And I hide it all with humor and a smile because I was bullied for being a crybaby so if I show people how much I'm hurting I'm vulnerable and a target so I'm scared to do so.

Caucasian people were rude to me and African American people would think I'm weird and judge me saying that I'm ""white-washed"" because I never had collard greens or braided my hair. With bullying and that, it has created a huge dent in my identity, self-esteem, and happiness because I'm always overthinking with anyone I come into counter with and over think sometimes with my appearance.

R_2rH0wOOmpZV8eru,EN,United States,24,Cisgender Man,Bisexual,White/European,NA,5,4,"My situation is definitely geographically-related, though it's complicated since I moved across the country about 2 years ago. I was originally living in a very conservative state in a community that shared my religious views, but was not supportive of queer identities. That was really challenging for me because there was no social support for me in my queer development, and that didn't change until I moved to where I am now. In my current location, I'm experiencing the opposite -- my queer identity is (usually) affirmed, but as I've grappled with how my religious identity intersects with that, I've found little support. People don't understand the tension as well as I would like them to, and I've had to wrestle with the tension pretty much alone. Now I'm in a place where I'm rejecting in my religious identity -- an experience with nuances that others don't seem to understand either. 

Because I spend most of my time in a big city, I feel safe because I'm just one of millions, but that also feels really isolating and erasing. I've struggled a lot more to understand who I am and who I want to be in such a context, because the tight-knit community I grew up in formed my identity even though it ultimately pushed me away."

Her mother didn't really show her compassionate love when she was little. Which I believe led her into settling for my father, she got pregnant and he's cheated on her, even has a baby with another woman. She stayed with him for the kids. He's the worst partner, she is forced to do everything, other than working. My father has never touched the stove in his life. My father has never been to one of my report card nights in school growing up. I often feel like he's very unhappy too, he came to America with nothing and is forced to stay here because of legal issues. He didn't see his father before he passed away and his mother is fading away currently. He's stuck here and my mother is stuck too.

If its about my home life or just my general area where I live. My home life absolutely sucks. For example my mom is rude to me a lot of the time and as soon as I try to protect myself and my feelings she says that Iâ€™m getting an attitude with her and that I need to grow up. I have a slow processing center. This means someone can get something as soon as someone says it but it takes me a couple moments to think about it process it and come up with an answer or a reply. My mom knows this and likes to use it against me. Knowing this my boyfriend tried to stand up for me a couple days ago and to put things in a nice way all hell broke lose. My mom told me that I make her feel worthless. I replied that she makes me feel the same way. She wasnâ€™t having that. He reply was that she gave up something very dear to her that she loved to have me (she was a respiratory therapist). She makes me feel guilty for being born. When I was a senior in high school I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (my anxiety is absolutely terrible sometimes I canâ€™t leave my house). My mom feels like I cheated the test and that I am a brat who just wants attention. Iâ€™ve never been able to get help and I feel the past few weeks have been a whole new worse for me. A couple weeks went by after I was diagnosed and suddenly my mom had super bad depression and anxiety. She blamed me for it. When I talk about moving in with my boyfriend my parents will not talk about it. They say Iâ€™m too young to talk about that (I am 19 and will be 20 in July). Iâ€™m 19 years old and my parents still control my every movement. ( I have to ask to go out I have to be in bed by 10 every night Iâ€™m not allowed to be alone with my boyfriend I am forced to go to church and they are upset that I donâ€™t want to become catholic) Me being afraid to make them upset Iâ€™ve always let them fo whatever, but now that Iâ€™m older I see it more.

I have two B.A.'s and working on my Masters. When I answered the question about having access to support (professional and personal), I knew that I represented a small percentage from my identity/zip code that has this access/privilege. 

In addition, I live in a fixed-income apartment. Due to this, I can afford to focus on education because I split a $670 rent which is do-able on part-time wages. I am also fortunate that no one in my family has a disability or severe illness. My household is one hospital trip away from being in serious debt. We live paycheck to paycheck. 

I very recently accepted a decent salary paying job with great job security. I was fortunate that I was able to dedicate myself to my education and professional development to land me this opportunity. Some of the other students I went to high school with that pursued a bachelors were not as lucky. Mental illness, physical illnesses, family priorities or deaths, and lack of general support are why i'm one of a few from my HS graduating class that made it this far. By no means am I any smarter or qualified than they are, i'm just fortunate. 

Tip: look up stats regarding education in zip code 93306/93305. Very low-income, low graduation rates, and schools severely underfunded.

Police oftentimes pick me out from crowds for a ''verdachtsunabhÃ¤ngige Kontrolle'' meaning that in theory anyone could be searched but they usually only search the immigrants.
Being gay in Germany is perpetually harder in small areas, which is why I live in big cities. Even then it still is hard, seeing as there is a rise of hate crimes in this country. I've oftentimes been yelled at for kissing someone or holding a guy's hands in public.
Health officials are oftentimes not very knowledgeable about queer issues (e.g gay and bi guys get some vaccines for free in Germany, that straight people don't), so it's always a fight for getting proper health management from your doctors.

Germany does have a big problem with how it handles minorities. In some cities it's a little better than in others, in general there's lots of problems that need to be adressed, especially since it is one of the wealthiest countries in the world."

Safety: I used to live in a much more dangerous neighborhood growing up but now I live in suburbia. I feel safe at all times, but I would still move back to where I was before since it has gentrified significantly.

Health: Thanks to MassHealth, even though I am poor, I have access to high quality healthcare for free. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I have no copays or limits to number of appointments. All my medications are $3.65 per 1 month fill. One of my prescriptions, Truvada, is discounted to $3.65, and then the rest is paid for by a state program called PrepDap that makes it free for those earning under a certain amount of money. Dental and vision are also covered with MassHealth. I donâ€™t think most other states would offer those same benefits.

Relationships:
- Friendships: I donâ€™t have many close friends. I feel as though I need to be in Boston to make more friends with similar interests since the demographics of where I live are not ones where I have the most commonalities with. I am glad I am in a more liberal location though, as making friends with conservative people can be much more difficult for me.
- Romantic/Sexual: Gay men seem to be only interested in hooking up, not long term relationships. I have tried living in other places (LA, NYC, Boston) and it was the same. I am planning to go through life alone since I see so many older gay men who are still single. I almost never see gay male couples.
- Familial: I live with my parents while I am in graduate school. I donâ€™t have a close relationship with either. But I feel that ignorance I was raised in a more socially conservative state I wouldnâ€™t be living with them at all.
- Educational: I am working on a masters degree at Boston University. I have been pushed towards higher education since elementary school. I donâ€™t think other locations have nearly as much emphasis/social expectation as Massachusetts/the northeast in general for children to go to college and particularly graduate school."

Speaking on my sexual identity itself, I struggle greatly. I only experience a sexual or physical attraction towards fictional characters. When I experience that attraction, I can't picture that character with me. It has to be a projection of myself in the form of a character for myself. That being said, it is hard to deal with life knowing that I won't get to meet any of the characters I love so much. It's been causing a lot of my depression recently.

My health nor safety would be impacted, but people would definitely question why I chose a girl of colour as my partner.  Growing up mixed (half German and half Japanese) impacted my mental health as a kid, as kids would bully me for my differences.  So unfortunately, I would expect some sort of backlash from the community that I live in if I dated a girl of different ethnic background.

While I am an immigrant I came here as a baby so it does not affect me too much if I were not able to talk English or have had an accent. The only experience I had where this was an issue was when I was younger where I would be teased for being Chinese and Korean at school and with strangers where kids would point out I'm Chinese. In more recent events I was insulted at a bus stop because I would not give a man money so he called me fucking immigrant. 

That being said my relative relationships with people are not too affected due to my sexual orientation or sexual identity. Where I am located, mental health is widely embraced and is rarely ridiculed. And probably the biggest issue I face is being Filipino, but even then it is not too bad."

Relationships in Toronto are the worst. You have to be a 7/10 or higher to find a relationship without unbearable difficulty.

However, Toronto still is the best environment for me considering financial supports, health supports, and overall social help.

This made me feel really unsafe because I could have died that day but I managed to get away even though these people had a knife pointed at me. The part that had me really concerned about my safety was that there were people nearby getting into a car who decided to pay no attention. After this, I walked on the opposite side of the street for months. Don't get me wrong growing up in this community was the absolute best even though we didn't enough money to do all the things kids had the opportunity to do we still made it fun. Growing up gay in a community predominately black people it was hard to come to terms with who I was because of a lot of negative stigma and bullying towards LGBTQ+ people.

A lot of the time it feels really isolated and lonely, even when you're surrounded by your friends. There's this sort of eeriness that comes with living here that you can't really shake. My location has lead to me to not report a rape because I wouldn't be able to afford all of the things that come along with it. My life feels very in the middle, but I know I have it better than a lot of people still, and that's even more depressing. The midwest sucks, but it also grants freedoms you don't really get anywhere else. Sitting on the roof of your car, stargazing with no one around you for miles can be leave you feeling really connected to the earth. Those moments make life worth something, it makes all the death threats for fighting for who you are and what you believe in worthwhile.

R_3qNJFXcpF4ypx4n,EN,United States,23,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Multi-Racial,NA,5,4,"Please consider that some of the phrasing of the survey and the image used to present the survey (the map filled with flags and other images) are somewhat problematic and offensive. For a group studying minority status as an impact in mental health, both your phrasing of minority issues and mental health issues is concerning. The phrasing ""Mentally unwell"" and ""Emotional disabled"" were confusing and don't really describe anything in particular. Would a person with an emotional illness, like Bipolar Disorder, be considered ""mentally unwell"" AND ""emotionally disabled?"" BPD is a disability under the DSM V, but I imagine may would ""self-identify"" as ""mentally unwell."" It just wasn't clear to me. Another offensive question was the one about suicide attempts. It came out of nowhere, and is likely triggering for a number of participants/potential participants. There was no warning in the consent form before the survey to talk about those issues, and no questions about a history of self-harm, or other examples of ways mental illness presents itself physically (e.g. eating disorders). Additionally on the long form page about family/friends/co-workers and whether sexual orientation is visible, two or three of the options were off the page and not even clickable. So I wanted to put N/A for some of them and simply could not. Your survey also seemed to teeter between focusing on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity as minorities, and Racial and/or Ethnic Identity. Those are two very large and complex areas of research on their own (as four, independent areas of research). I feel very strongly, as an academic myself completing research currently on Critical Race Theory, that you are not gaining anything of actual substance from the survey you've launched. Overall your language and imagery is questionable at best for a group of academics, and I'm disappointed. You may want to add some trigger warning(s) to the consent page. Also you may want to add to your consent page that this survey is not IRB Approved. If it were, you would have stated it.


Now to answer this actual question: As a multiracial, multiethnic, Cis-Hetero woman, I feel location plays an overt role in my relationships and my access to resources. The ability to be as educated as I am is a privilege, and places me in a socio-economic class that also directly impacts the same. Living in Connecticut, there is an abundance of wealth and a higher standard of living than where I grew up in the South. I feel much safer here than in some of the urban areas I've lived in the past, and I feel racism, sexism, and homophobia are far less common here in New England than they were in the South. That isn't to say it doesn't all exist, because it does. It is just much less blatant in the North East than it is in the South."

My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything,  Since than im kind of really scared of people.  So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own.
I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself.

Only the friends of my friend are there who rejected me or did not understand my behavior. Emotionally I was very wavering. Sometimes turned up, sometimes depressed. After a while when I started doing something with people I became more open and cheerful again. There was no contact with other people (my people). Making your own contacts is very important. Now I was really looking forward to the summer semester. Everything becomes colorful and warm. I wanted to do more. Start my hobby again. Concentrate on myself and experience Wurzburg and accept and get to know my new home. Only now the corona virus came and everything seems to be getting more complicated again.

Because I donâ € ™ t want to be judged by people who donâ € ™ t want to see my qualifications behind my â € œoutsideâ €. Many of my friends in 2nd / 3rd / 4th Generation can share similar experiences. Otherwise I have never experienced racism in Germany until 2012, but since then there have been &quot;racist problems&quot; almost every day. Germany is a very social, innovative, safe and fair country. Without said everyday racism it would still be a dream. :)"
R_QfZ3bmLj5u8GEzD,DE,Germany,21,Cisgender Woman,Bisexual,Deutsch,Not Actively Religious/Athiest,5,3,"Lack of doctors burdened (a psychologist and gynecologist would be necessary for me), I feel comfortable and relatively safe in my living environment (in any case safer than before I moved to this city), my new place of residence has had a positive effect on my mental health"

R_TtEWc34Wzb2q4ff,DE,Germany,25,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Larger Bodied,6,2,"I live very rural with my parents in a big house. It takes us over half an hour to get to the nearest hospital. When my mother was sick recently, I first became aware of this distance. If we want to go out in the evening, to the cinema or to an indoor swimming pool, we drive almost an hour. The motorway (no matter in which direction) is min. half an hour away. For young people, of course, that&#39;s often annoying. In return, we have the same distance to all larger cities (eg Kaiserslautern). All in all, I feel very comfortable here and couldn&#39;t imagine living in a small apartment in the city for long. So when I finish my studies, I definitely want to stay around here somewhere."
R_2R4CRhasnhBu7HB,DE,Germany,24,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Religious Minority,6,7,"Because I live in Germany, I have a lot of security. No matter what, I always know I&#39;ll never be left without anything. Health insurance also helps a lot."
R_1M3ZoDvYkNl5EpT,DE,Germany,36,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Mentally Unwell,5,6,"I would like to live somewhere else, where I live is just a compromise. Moved here for work and stayed because of a partner. But the place of residence itself is fine. Comfortable, inexpensive, a lot of culture and relatively safe. Just not nice."

R_1o6WAHXNQ4aIkIE,DE,Germany,19,Transgender Man,Bisexual,Deutsch,Mentally Unwell,5,6,"My family (I currently live with my mother, my parents are separated) pulls me down a lot because I don&#39;t feel perceived as a man. However, I am very satisfied with my geographic location and I feel safe here. Only relationships with a few people limit me."
R_3F54TchOqcWrl62,DE,Finland,20,Cisgender Man,Bisexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,6,6,"My current place of residence definitely influences my current well-being. I have many friends around me, the opportunity to escape everyday life by bike or on foot and to go into nature. There are about 4 supermarkets in the immediate vicinity and I have enough light in the room. In addition, the whole health system in Finland is good, so I am not worried if something should happen to me and medical treatment is needed."

It means that I can cultivate these friendships."
R_3QDVpd8zr9mTHXu,DE,Germany,32,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Low Resourced,6,5,"It is and always has been my home, even if I lived somewhere else for several years. Most of my family and many of my friends live there. I like the people and the life in the country. Everyone knows everyone, and I&#39;ve missed that very much in the big city. The world is still all right here and I just feel good and safe."

I also feel safer with my sexuality than in other places. But big cities are also sometimes exhausting for groups of friends

R_beaUTKovfG5wWhr,DE,Germany,19,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Mentally Unwell,5,5,"I feel safe. Sometimes safe. Relations with the family partly close (same house) partly very far away (Thuringia, Saxony). Relationships with friends only in neighboring towns, not accessible on foot.

Out of a shared apartment in your own apartment - Hurray! Friends, the park (for my dog), the university and good shopping opportunities (organic shop, unpackaged shop) are nearby.

R_3qvrnabXdVAjlx8,DE,Germany,23,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Alone,5,6,"I&#39;m in a long-distance relationship and live alone in a one-room apartment. On the one hand it gives me a kind of security to come home in the evening and to know that the place belongs only to me and that I can take as much peace and time for myself as I want here. I don&#39;t have to justify myself with anything or anyone and can decide everything by myself. On the other hand, I am alone here with my thoughts and cannot speak to anyone. Living alone sometimes gives me too much time to think, which sometimes makes me nervous and unsettled. Sometimes it makes me isolate myself from others. I like to live in a city that offers all the advantages of a city, but is small enough that it feels homely and you can sometimes recognize strangers on the bus. I live 1 1/2 hours away from my original home and my family. Just far enough to live away from home and still be able to visit often enough. Sometimes I would rather live in the country. The city is sometimes oppressive. You can never escape for a moment and you can never take a break. Everything is always moving and loud and the air is so suffocating and dirty at times. I love my balcony, but even there it&#39;s too loud to switch off without headphones."

The climatic conditions in my place of residence, less snow and cold as well as warmer and more lakes and rivers, I clearly prefer to places of residence. Being close to friends and family is also more personal when the journey times are not so long."

When it comes to an argument with my partner, however, I lose the feeling of security and prefer to break free. No matter where. My place of residence is good for my mental health, because I feel driven to take care of myself by a feeling of responsibility towards my partner and myself."
R_3D6GJLNxSvCM1SU,DE,Germany,27,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,Addiction/In Recovery,6,7,"I like where I live, even if it took some getting used to living in a small town.

R_xhX9RqbOFEYwlgZ,DE,Germany,19,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,White/European,Alone,5,5,"I moved to Siegen from Greece alone. I like living alone but at the same time scares me because I am alone with my thoughts. Which can be somber at times. However, I always manage to get out of such negative thoughts. Because I lived / grew up in a bigger city before, I feel confined in here. As if I were given opportunities to discover something new."
