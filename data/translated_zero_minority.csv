While I now attend medical school and have had a solid socioeconomic standing while growing up. My school and community was severely underserved. The community does not hold many of the important specialties, especially when concerning pediatric care. More so, mental health initiatives and counseling help is extremely limited in the area and can lead to challenges throughout the community. 

For example, I was required to travel close to 200 miles round trip in order to receive treatment for a pediatric bleeding disorder as a child. The closest PICU is the same distance and has led to significant challenges for both my family and even more throughout the community. Emergency medicine is the highest risk in the area as transport can lead to poor health outcomes, particularly due tot he isolation associated with the community. The areas tobacco and drug problems are a extremely significant as well, as a result of previous tobacco  industry in the area, lack of resources to mental and physical health, poor education system, and low socioeconomic status. 

Watauga county has the largest socioeconomic disparity in the state of N.C. this translates to a food insecurity rate approaching 25-33%, an astounding number. This further complicates health in the region."

R_3HjLSEEhSpQfetn,DE,Germany,29,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,4,5,"After 2 years in Cologne I moved back to my hometown. Since I had to quickly find out that the city ideal is not mine. When I was in my early twenties, I found the small town climate cramped and annoying. Today it gives me security and I don&#39;t want to do without certain familiarities in the area."
R_26hX03Eby5vm6LS,DE,Germany,24,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,5,5,"Place of residence: not a safe area, now and then fear of burglary"

R_DPkzONRpdFP1Xjz,DE,Germany,22,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,7,7,"I feel safer and more comfortable when I live close to family and friends (&lt;30 minutes by car). When I lived further away during my semester abroad, it had a huge impact on my mental state, I was often unhappy."
R_yVh0NicZRHjr5M5,DE,Germany,23,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,6,6,"I really live in the country and I think the community of people my age is really good! You are totally networked and know almost everyone here. Which is of course great for friendships and security on the one hand, but on the other hand it is also a bit difficult to find new relationships. Besides, our family doctor isn&#39;t that competent here in the village, but there are very few alternatives."
R_1jHPH5AedjhdnUC,DE,Germany,29,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,6,5,My place of residence influences me positively.

That didn&#39;t work, but I stayed there because I don&#39;t really feel at home in my home town in Swabia anymore."
R_3LjYAXH0oqho5vS,DE,Germany,22,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,7,7,"Since I have a long-distance relationship and often commute back and forth between my place of residence, my parents and my partner, I often have the feeling that I don&#39;t have a fixed center of life because these 3 places hardly overlap and are different groups of friends in all 3 places. I very much wish that I had a steady center of life. Otherwise the place of residence is perfectly fine and no worse or better than anywhere else. Unfortunately, it&#39;s sometimes very dirty in the dormitory, which is why I don&#39;t like cooking there, although I usually like to do it."
R_2wprNTMBTH61GdF,DE,Germany,20,Cisgender Man,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,6,6,"Row of homes, terraced houses with their own garden, safe area, good access to ÖPNV, elementary school, playground, forest, restaurants and snack bars in the immediate vicinity, a few friends in the neighborhood - but little contact"

R_RE13FJ5r4YI6T05,DE,Germany,62,Cisgender Man,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,7,7,"I moved 5 years ago with my wife. We live in a large apartment in the city center, have a balcony and terrace and are very aware that we are privileged. As long as we both stay healthy, we&#39;ll probably stay very happy too."
R_Qn2kqCbFAH92KWd,DE,Germany,24,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,5,5,"I find Hildesheim a less safe place than other places (I&#39;ve moved more often) because a lot of strange people walk around here, especially at night, the Ö-PNV is very bad for Hildesheim being officially a big city, but you have relatively good connections to other larger cities and, accordingly, all the supply options you need, the people are not as open as in the Rhineland, for example, but also not quite as closed as in northern Germany"

I&#39;ve always wanted to live in a beautiful old town and that&#39;s why I feel very comfortable there. That will probably help me find my balance at home and recharge my batteries.

R_3KwNIU6DYlIvZwl,DE,Germany,23,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,5,5,"My place of residence is freedom for me (I lived very remote as a child). Close to the city center, access to all shops for daily needs, everything is within walking distance. I meet friends more often and go partying more often because it is no longer difficult (how do I get home?). However, I used to be sick less often in the country than I am now."
R_2vY21jHITRfRWva,DE,Germany,23,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,7,6,"The place of residence is a village, which means that there is a lot of space in the apartment / house and a high level of cohesion among the neighbors. In addition, security is very high and the green surroundings with lots of nature lead to better physical and mental health than living in the city."
R_2ctHkomWPrsiwtp,DE,Germany,19,Cisgender Woman,Heterosexual,Deutsch,No Minority Identities/None/None of Above/Blank/Priveleged Identity Listed,5,5,"My place of residence is still relatively new to me (moved in 6 months ago). There was something liberating, if at times frightening, about moving out of my parents&#39; house. All in all, it wasn&#39;t difficult for me to leave my hometown. In Leipzig I feel very well and at home now. I live in a shared apartment with 3 flatmates, it took me a while to get used to, but now I get on very well with them and I&#39;m happy to see them again."
