I did not feel safe. Living in West Virginia for school, where it is quiet and small and rural, I feel much happier and safer.

That was really challenging for me because there was no social support for me in my queer development, and that didn't change until I moved to where I am now. In my current location, I'm experiencing the opposite -- my queer identity is (usually) affirmed, but as I've grappled with how my religious identity intersects with that, I've found little support. People don't understand the tension as well as I would like them to, and I've had to wrestle with the tension pretty much alone. Now I'm in a place where I'm rejecting in my religious identity -- an experience with nuances that others don't seem to understand either. 

Because I spend most of my time in a big city, I feel safe because I'm just one of millions, but that also feels really isolating and erasing. I've struggled a lot more to understand who I am and who I want to be in such a context, because the tight-knit community I grew up in formed my identity even though it ultimately pushed me away. "

For example my mom is rude to me a lot of the time and as soon as I try to protect myself and my feelings she says that Iâ€™m getting an attitude with her and that I need to grow up. I have a slow processing center. This means someone can get something as soon as someone says it but it takes me a couple moments to think about it process it and come up with an answer or a reply. My mom knows this and likes to use it against me. Knowing this my boyfriend tried to stand up for me a couple days ago and to put things in a nice way all hell broke lose. My mom told me that I make her feel worthless. I replied that she makes me feel the same way. She wasnâ€™t having that. He reply was that she gave up something very dear to her that she loved to have me (she was a respiratory therapist). She makes me feel guilty for being born. When I was a senior in high school I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (my anxiety is absolutely terrible sometimes I canâ€™t leave my house). My mom feels like I cheated the test and that I am a brat who just wants attention. Iâ€™ve never been able to get help and I feel the past few weeks have been a whole new worse for me. A couple weeks went by after I was diagnosed and suddenly my mom had super bad depression and anxiety. She blamed me for it. When I talk about moving in with my boyfriend my parents will not talk about it. They say Iâ€™m too young to talk about that (I am 19 and will be 20 in July). Iâ€™m 19 years old and my parents still control my every movement. ( I have to ask to go out I have to be in bed by 10 every night Iâ€™m not allowed to be alone with my boyfriend I am forced to go to church and they are upset that I donâ€™t want to become catholic) Me being afraid to make them upset Iâ€™ve always let them fo whatever, but now that Iâ€™m older I see it more. Iâ€™m just afraid to make them upset. Not sure if thatâ€™s what you meant but I needed to get that off my chest. "

I have two B.A.'s and working on my Masters. When I answered the question about having access to support (professional and personal), I knew that I represented a small percentage from my identity/zip code that has this access/privilege. 

In addition, I live in a fixed-income apartment. Due to this, I can afford to focus on education because I split a $670 rent which is do-able on part-time wages. I am also fortunate that no one in my family has a disability or severe illness. My household is one hospital trip away from being in serious debt. We live paycheck to paycheck. 

I very recently accepted a decent salary paying job with great job security. I was fortunate that I was able to dedicate myself to my education and professional development to land me this opportunity. Some of the other students I went to high school with that pursued a bachelors were not as lucky. Mental illness, physical illnesses, family priorities or deaths, and lack of general support are why i'm one of a few from my HS graduating class that made it this far. By no means am I any smarter or qualified than they are, i'm just fortunate. 

Tip: look up stats regarding education in zip code 93306/93305. Very low-income, low graduation rates, and schools severely underfunded. No or little access to mental health or general health resources. East Bakersfield, and Southeast Bakersfield are the communities I grew up in/I am referring to in my comments."

Being gay in Germany is perpetually harder in small areas, which is why I live in big cities. Even then it still is hard, seeing as there is a rise of hate crimes in this country. I've oftentimes been yelled at for kissing someone or holding a guy's hands in public.
Health officials are oftentimes not very knowledgeable about queer issues (e.g gay and bi guys get some vaccines for free in Germany, that straight people don't), so it's always a fight for getting proper health management from your doctors.

Dating is extremely challenging because so many people have internalized homophobia and because most people my age are substantially more politically conservative than I. I do not feel a sense of safety related to my identities when in public, and this becomes much more salient in rural suburbs. I find myself code switching to pass as straight to keep questions from coming my way. Although our campus is tolerant of the LGBTQ community, there are very few opportunities to meet and interact with others on campus and almost zero opportunities to meet other gay graduate students. Itâ€™s a lonely experience that will thankfully end soon."

Safety: I used to live in a much more dangerous neighborhood growing up but now I live in suburbia. I feel safe at all times, but I would still move back to where I was before since it has gentrified significantly.

Health: Thanks to MassHealth, even though I am poor, I have access to high quality healthcare for free. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I have no copays or limits to number of appointments. All my medications are $3.65 per 1 month fill. One of my prescriptions, Truvada, is discounted to $3.65, and then the rest is paid for by a state program called PrepDap that makes it free for those earning under a certain amount of money. Dental and vision are also covered with MassHealth. I donâ€™t think most other states would offer those same benefits.

Relationships:
- Friendships: I donâ€™t have many close friends. I feel as though I need to be in Boston to make more friends with similar interests since the demographics of where I live are not ones where I have the most commonalities with. I am glad I am in a more liberal location though, as making friends with conservative people can be much more difficult for me.
- Romantic/Sexual: Gay men seem to be only interested in hooking up, not long term relationships. I have tried living in other places (LA, NYC, Boston) and it was the same. I am planning to go through life alone since I see so many older gay men who are still single. I almost never see gay male couples.
- Familial: I live with my parents while I am in graduate school. I donâ€™t have a close relationship with either. But I feel that ignorance I was raised in a more socially conservative state I wouldnâ€™t be living with them at all.
- Educational: I am working on a masters degree at Boston University. I have been pushed towards higher education since elementary school. I donâ€™t think other locations have nearly as much emphasis/social expectation as Massachusetts/the northeast in general for children to go to college and particularly graduate school."

We're pretty disconnected from any large city (the closest one being Concord NH, which is a 30 minute drive). There's not a lot of people to become friends with. You get stuck with a pool of kids your age, or you get to form relationships with the local college students from New England College. It becomes hard when you don't like the people you're around, or they disassociate with you, and you have to find a new group of friends. I'm pretty introverted so it hasn't been easy to keep friends. The town itself is quite safe so I don't worry for my safety or health.

Speaking on my sexual identity itself, I struggle greatly. I only experience a sexual or physical attraction towards fictional characters. When I experience that attraction, I can't picture that character with me. It has to be a projection of myself in the form of a character for myself. That being said, it is hard to deal with life knowing that I won't get to meet any of the characters I love so much. It's been causing a lot of my depression recently. It's especially hard on my significant other. I am romantically attached to him but I never get the same sexual urges that he does. We tend to fight a lot over my sexuality because he doesn't personally understand it."

This made me feel really unsafe because I could have died that day but I managed to get away even though these people had a knife pointed at me. The part that had me really concerned about my safety was that there were people nearby getting into a car who decided to pay no attention. After this, I walked on the opposite side of the street for months. Don't get me wrong growing up in this community was the absolute best even though we didn't enough money to do all the things kids had the opportunity to do we still made it fun.

For a group studying minority status as an impact in mental health, both your phrasing of minority issues and mental health issues is concerning. The phrasing ""Mentally unwell"" and ""Emotional disabled"" were confusing and don't really describe anything in particular. Would a person with an emotional illness, like Bipolar Disorder, be considered ""mentally unwell"" AND ""emotionally disabled?"" BPD is a disability under the DSM V, but I imagine may would ""self-identify"" as ""mentally unwell."" It just wasn't clear to me. Another offensive question was the one about suicide attempts. It came out of nowhere, and is likely triggering for a number of participants/potential participants. There was no warning in the consent form before the survey to talk about those issues, and no questions about a history of self-harm, or other examples of ways mental illness presents itself physically (e.g. eating disorders). Additionally on the long form page about family/friends/co-workers and whether sexual orientation is visible, two or three of the options were off the page and not even clickable. So I wanted to put N/A for some of them and simply could not. Your survey also seemed to teeter between focusing on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity as minorities, and Racial and/or Ethnic Identity. Those are two very large and complex areas of research on their own (as four, independent areas of research). I feel very strongly, as an academic myself completing research currently on Critical Race Theory, that you are not gaining anything of actual substance from the survey you've launched. Overall your language and imagery is questionable at best for a group of academics, and I'm disappointed. You may want to add some trigger warning(s) to the consent page. Also you may want to add to your consent page that this survey is not IRB Approved. If it were, you would have stated it.


Now to answer this actual question: As a multiracial, multiethnic, Cis-Hetero woman, I feel location plays an overt role in my relationships and my access to resources. The ability to be as educated as I am is a privilege, and places me in a socio-economic class that also directly impacts the same. Living in Connecticut, there is an abundance of wealth and a higher standard of living than where I grew up in the South. I feel much safer here than in some of the urban areas I've lived in the past, and I feel racism, sexism, and homophobia are far less common here in New England than they were in the South. That isn't to say it doesn't all exist, because it does. It is just much less blatant in the North East than it is in the South."

Ich muss mich mit nichts und vor niemandem rechtfertigen und kann alles alleine entscheiden. Andererseits bin ich hier mit meinen Gedanken alleine und kann mit niemandem sprechen. Alleine zu wohnen gibt mir manchmal zu viel Zeit zum nachdenken, was mich manchmal nervÃ¶s macht und verunsichert. Es fÃ¼hrt manchmal dazu, dass ich mich von anderen abschotte.

Ich mag es in einer Stadt zu wohnen, die alle Vorteile einer Stadt bietet, aber klein genug ist, sodass es heimelig wirkt und man manchmal fremde Personen im Bus wiedererkennt. Ich wohne 1 1/2h entfernt von meiner ursprÃ¼nglichen Heimat und meiner Familie. Gerade weit genug um weg von zuhause zu wohnen und trotzdem oft genug zu Besuch kommen zu kÃ¶nnen. Manchmal wÃ¼rde ich lieber auf dem Land wohnen. Die Stadt ist manchmal beklemmend. Man kann ihr nie mal kurz entfliehen und kann nie pausieren. Alles ist immer in Bewegung und laut und die Luft ist manchmal so erstickend und dreckig. Ich liebe meinen Balkon, aber selbst dort ist es ohne KopfhÃ¶rer zu laut um abzuschalten."
