3,0.65%,"all_R_2xVRkkm8EMNghKy : I live in an academic environment where the focus is almost always on education. This it's difficult to cultivate strong interpersonal relationships, but not impossible. With regard to mental health, it's also difficult to physically find a confidant. There are hardly any professional psychiatrists around, and the greater population here knows little or nothing about mental health. There are thieves and robbers, but of course I try to avoid trouble by staying safe and ensuring my security."

5,0.32%,"all_R_2awvnOf8v6BLbqg : I'm sort of in the middle of a corn field, so traveling anywhere to see friends or family is a pain. Driving to practice or to the store can take half an hour or more at times. I prefer it to living in a crowded city or suburb though."
06-Jul,0.26%,"all_R_1jqt8ThJnHtBQWW : I feel very isolated. I am so far away from my family, so I rarely am hugged or kissed by loved ones. I cannot find a PCP, so I worry about my health all the time. I am very lonely."

12,0.27%,"all_R_3snSBIzQubGNeJQ : I think it is more of the people in the location that impacts me because even if they have norms and cultural things they believe in, it is still up to the morality of the person to judge someone"

14,0.33%,all_R_3kivrloOLx7Xc3K : Everything here is so competitive and fast. People are sometimes shallow; tend to see short-term goals rather than long term which i think made it toxic. I try everyday to get away with it but i keep on convincing myself i just have to adapt.

Tend to not share my location with others of different ethnicity that aren't my own due to fear of racism

25,1.55%,"all_R_3kGKEl33LxksxsF : There's this music genre and community coined as ""midwest emos"" and I think most people who have grown up in the midwest can agree to feeling depressed a lot of the time, especially when they're further away from bigger cities. A lot of the time it feels really isolated and lonely, even when you're surrounded by your friends. There's this sort of eeriness that comes with living here that you can't really shake. My location has lead to me to not report a rape because I wouldn't be able to afford all of the things that come along with it. My life feels very in the middle, but I know I have it better than a lot of people still, and that's even more depressing. The midwest sucks, but it also grants freedoms you don't really get anywhere else. Sitting on the roof of your car, stargazing with no one around you for miles can be leave you feeling really connected to the earth. Those moments make life worth something, it makes all the death threats for fighting for who you are and what you believe in worthwhile. It takes time to realize these things though, and I'm really grateful that I did. There's still a lot of things that could be useful for kids living in rural areas, but it isn't all hopeless all of the time."
26,0.39%,"all_R_1dtYA4CeVgt7dNA : Living in San Jose has made me worried just by walking around my neighborhood. I cannot form friendly or romantic relationships due to previous experiences. My relationship and safety are a big concern, but with all the health-care facilities around, I am certain my health can be managed."
27,0.80%,"all_R_2RPsurlEtgCe4HO : I felt that because of the neighborhood I grew up in and the kind of people around me I was never able to really be myself. Hanging out with friends of a different gender got me slut-shamed by my parents and our church in middle school and that's stuck with me ever since. Because I grew up in a very conservative, religious neighborhood I had to deal with people talking trash about people of different gender identities, sexual orientations, and races. It painted a very grim picture of the world to me. It also didn't help that not only did my parents not believe in mental illnesses but also couldn't afford therapy."
28,0.28%,all_R_2VwGfU3wIjn04am : I am thankful to live somewhere where I can have all of my necessities to keep me going during these hard times. I have a girlfriend who goes to Pace with me but lives and Miami and we miss each other.
29,0.25%,all_R_3FQdWUbKbEAjOeD : It's a close community where it's mostly family members living around. It's kind of hard having my own space when there are high expectations of me inside and outside of the home.
30,0.56%,"all_R_ZrWxAh3N1e6nMkN : I am in the middle of nowhere and all my friends already went home. So I'm super depressed since I know no one from Merced and nothing to do. If I was back in my home town Mountain View then I would not be having these feelings. Also, people are less open minded here so I'm not always comfortable holding my girlfriends hand in public or giving her any form of affection. I've received dirty looks when I have in the past."

34 - 35,0.50%,"all_R_2CIKifAoVDFxCxZ : Being at home has impacted me a lot because my family expects me to be a certain person that I don't have to be when i'm away, its hard to show your change when they have such a strong idea of who they think you are.. I am more confined and have a lot of responsibilities that can overwhelm me when I have to balance with school. I'm further away from the people I trust most."
36,0.32%,"all_R_1DoKGYJBVZl31fo : Well, since I'm in College I live far away from my families, but I got some friends that make me feel like home. Also, there are not a lot of public transportation so it makes it kind of hard to move around since I do not have a car."

01-Feb,0.79%,zero_R_3L7LnKACywaDTgv : I live in a very wealthy neighborhood. I have always had access to anything and everything I needed as a child. I never felt unsafe walking to the local town or biking to my workplace. I do feel isolated from my peers as i live very far from my current school. This strains my relationships with friends as i have to rely on calling and facetime when i need someone to talk to. However living at home strains my relationship with my parents as we have very different lifestyles. I have never worried about not having access to health care services.
03-Apr,0.21%,zero_R_1LbcV7Va5EjNYIa : My location sometimes makes me feel very isolated. We are not a very diverse state and I feel exposed to more when traveling.
05-Jun,0.38%,"zero_R_28YtRtNUU8mO6O1 : I generally feel uncomfortable in Aachen. I wouldn&amp;#39;t call my fellow students there as close friends either, but rather as nice acquaintances, with whom, with perhaps one exception, I won&amp;#39;t have anything to do with in 5-10 years."
7,0.67%,"zero_R_3NHSiVoDFtgagnO : My place of residence is very safe. I live in this house with a lot of people who are like me and I needn&amp;#39;t fear. I have a lot of nature around me and can therefore go out often and a lot to recharge my batteries. However, I live alone, which is why I am lonely sometimes. But most of the time that is terribly good for me and I like to structure my daily routine and my apartment myself. Living alone has made me very self-confident and independent."
08-Sep,1.34%,"zero_R_2v2GJ0BQkdlp7ix : I am currently commuting back and forth between my home, my place of study and the place of residence of my partner (we are not married + he does not live in Germany). Due to the Covid-19 situation, I moved the 400km back to my home, as I have several foster care cases and high-risk patients in the family who my brother and I support. This also means that the visit from my life partner is no longer necessary. The distance puts a strain on the relationship, but I will move away from emden and after our studies are over we will see. I feel safe in all three places. I don&amp;#39;t regret the decision to change my place of residence due to my studies. Emden is a very pleasant city. It&amp;#39;s big enough but not a big city. Everything is on site and everything can be reached on foot or by bike. The only thing that is a shame is the poor networking of the buses. However, there is a train station in town with a pretty good connection."
10,0.16%,all_R_1HksGwbOqLU6Je5 : I am very far from my family and it sometimes gets really hard knowing I can't see them.
Nov-13,0.31%,all_R_29cR01ROGs5RiyQ : My current location benefits me because I am able to continue my education and spend time with my friends. My location is also inconvenient to me because I am hours away from my family and girlfriend.
14,0.17%,all_R_3NxFXaSdiDPZJpS : my location impacts me because im not used to living on my own yet and just missing my family.
15,0.22%,"all_R_22Am5N3utH96sCS : I live in the country in a small town so there is little to no crime, but there aren't many people so relationships are hard to find."
16,0.44%,all_R_3MMpEk4WEb3UaGF : I would say that my location doesn't affect me physically but since I moved so far away from home it has affected some of my friend relationships. I have definitely lost touch with a lot of people that I wish I was still close to and that has had a little bit of an effect on my mood at times.
17,0.10%,all_R_3kpIfpPcqz946ph : location makes me feel isolated from others
18 - 20,0.31%,all_R_2rq4GKlnT8xtui7 : I do not think my geographic location is a source of a lot of my problems. I do think that being away from those who care about me and I believe to be important in my life does effect me negatively.
21 - 22,0.87%,"all_R_1kUDvP3cuCVMVtT : I live basically in the middle of nowhere, is how my relatives and I describe it. For as long as I can remember I have felt disconnected from my community and friendships because they all live close to each other and spend time with each other while I'm left behind. Because of this, growing up I feel easily attachable to new people in my life and it is hard to cope with leaving relationships behind. For example, moving to college is tough for most people but struggling with being away from my family and siblings has been extremely rough and has a large impact on my work ethic in college thus far."
23,0.55%,"all_R_1dyjaT0kjUpxpzt : I think my location benefits me that I have a lot of resources around me, including therapists, doctors, and so much more. However, around me it is less common to talk about my problems as openly, leading my parents to not understand every aspect. This makes it hard to actually get help somewhere, especially if I am struggling with the motivation to do it on my own."
24 - 26,0.44%,"all_R_2WBEoLqzB7kCyQa : I am originally from the Champaign area so I moved 2 1/2 hours from home. Some days I enjoy being away, but most days I struggle. I am very homesick and my anxiety has shot through the roof ever since I moved to Carbondale. I like the area, I just hate being so far from home/friends/family."
27 - 29,0.35%,all_R_RI7Tz5JwCkez4LD : My location does have a big impact because I am not as close to friends and family as I would like to be and that encouraged me to move to New York to be closer to family. I still live in California for some parts of the year.
30 - 32,0.45%,"all_R_eEE9wmlPETgUSnn : I am actually from California so this is a whole new change for me. Living across the country and being a 5-6 hr plane ride from my family is pretty hard. But I realized that all my relationships with my parents, sister and friends from back home grew a lot stronger because I talk to them everyday."
33 - 35,0.26%,"all_R_1gbUdILu0SIEyxy : My neighborhood is considered wealthy and safe; versus where I was raised. I feel at ease in my neighborhood, however, My friends and family live in other places."
1,0.32%,"all_R_3MtWewxHa6jNcKZ : I live in New York City which is an excellent location for my career, but not close to any of my family members, which is a definite downside. Most of the people I associate myself with here have the same mindset I do, for example, politically. That, for me, is a positive thing."
2,0.21%,all_R_22Q63r39PNQu7gp : I think being away from my immediate family while attending college puts stress on me because I am responsible for financial things while being a full time student.
3,0.33%,"all_R_29cxYfb1OqZiml7 : I'm in a fairly liberal City in the US, so being out to casual acquaintances is usually not a problem. My father will not allow me or my family to stay in his house because it is against his religious views. He lives in southern California, as does my mother (they are divorced)."
4,0.35%,"all_R_27mrLYE5vEwZEex : My location has made it so mental health isnÉ??t talked about or taken seriously. I could never go see a therapist or I would be the family shame or secret. Generally IÉ??m safe, but oftentimes IÉ??m not out at night without my S/O or friends. If I were to be out at night, IÉ??d be scared for my safety."
5,0.15%,"all_R_2sbZQCQsv8Py83m : I am 1.5 hours away from my family, so that is not my ideal situation. Other than that I feel fine where I am at"
6,0.13%,all_R_1PUJWPXRFabMC3N : Im in a long-distance relationship and itÉ??s very hard in terms of trust and time management
1,0.63%,"all_R_2b29GoV09q9fSOv : I live in a highly populated urban area. I have social anxiety which means that even though there are a lot of people around, including other queer people, nature lovers, and artists like me, it is hard to connect. It is still better than being in a rural area though. I also have better access and more options with healthcare. Things are strange due to COVID right now and more difficult but before that it was easier to get to appointments (public transit) and I had options on where to go. I live farther away from family now and that can be difficult, but I call my mom and grandmas often."
2,0.22%,all_R_dgNRsFtLDe9NTcB : ItÉ??s not super safe for people like me but the resources here are plentiful. Also having family that doesnÉ??t acknowledge any gender identities that arenÉ??t assigned at birth doesnÉ??t help.
3,0.69%,"all_R_1n0jKcCbzrPN4g5 : Pretty distant from the violence that happens in Longview that my coworkers have to deal with. I have two amazing best friends, my fiance whom I live with and a best friend that lives in the same state and they support me in every possible way. My life would be miserable without them because my family doesn't understand. I'm going to admit here that I'm starting to consider myself Agender but I don't know if I'd ever admit that to my family because my asexuality already makes me a joke. I have discussed Agender with my best friends though, more as a concept, but they're so open to talking about anything that I feel safe with them no matter what."
4,0.39%,all_R_3JDwRXeG52QHI66 : I feel safe in exploring my gender/sexuality because I live close to NYC. I feel racially/ethnically isolated because I live in suburban NJ where there are few people who share my culture and language. It makes me feel disconnected and I am constantly disappointed in my fluency because I have very little opportunity to practice speaking my native language.
5,0.18%,all_R_3iqKBMYVAbFe0cj : I honestly just moved so I donÉ??t know for sure yet. Very isolated sort of place: small town so people arenÉ??t super forward thinking which sucks.
6,0.13%,"all_R_Rkxxi2nh3J9kjvj : My roommate situation causes grief, and I am not physically close enough to people that care about me."
7,0.41%,"all_R_2t36qEYTXr0izeZ : Living in Texas, even in San Antonio, isn't safe for the trans community. Last week, a transwoman was stabbed to death because ""god sent this guy"" to kill her. I live 5,000 miles away from my husband, one of my biggest sources of social support. I have some support here, but living away from my husband has a massive negative impact on my emotional well-being and overall stability."
8,0.73%,"all_R_1LB5LpZ13lBga46 : Phoenix is family orientated with a strong republican foundation for values. They do not have a large LGBT population and make active strides to limit LGBT events &amp; functions. As a working professional, Phoenix provides great job growth and competitive salaries. With that being said, Phoenix does not provide a sense of community and makes it nearly impossible to meet other LGBT individuals. As a young adult (22), I am actively seeking to relocate in hopes of meeting other like-minded individuals &amp; to be become apart of a community. Phoenix isnÉ??t the worst when it comes to LGBT representation, but it does create a sense of loneliness due to the lack of community and resources."
09-Oct,1.91%,"all_R_2eXBZZiMB0KLL6F : Im an FTM transgender who live in the less open minded side of israel. I rarely go out of home and stuck with no job for 2 years now. My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything, Since than im kind of really scared of people. So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it. A dream. Im sure thats also illusion. And that theres no really safe space anywhere ."
11,0.18%,all_R_1eKPqyWu58qo913 : My area is mostly older and very conservative. Not only is it frustrating to find support but I feel there's no representation for my community here.
12,0.08%,all_R_eUV1l02O6CO0s4F : Im isolated as we have poor public transportation
13,0.24%,"all_R_1eFsdlETER0f8gl : I live in an extremely conservative area and basically hide a substantial part of myself in order to survive and fit in. I do not have friends locally, my husband is an anomaly as far as someone who I can be me with."
14,0.17%,all_R_31pkKT7E45id1xO : our location is ok. Isolating sometimes. Everything i need for like health seems very far away so sometimes not worth the effort to go to or get.
15,0.58%,"all_R_RCcsehleciteGM9 : I donÉ??t really know many other queer people here. There was an openly trans guy in one of my classes and a trans woman in another, both whoÉ??d already started there transition. As someone who hasnÉ??t started anything and might end up being non-binary, I didnÉ??t really feel like I could talk to them about being gender queer because I donÉ??t know they might be transmed or enby-phobic. Besides that, everyone else kinda seems to live in a queer free world, and you canÉ??t tell whoÉ??s queer-phobic, awkward around queer people, or an ally"
16 - 17,0.95%,"all_R_wOa1YKmNZsi5uIp : Job security is pretty minimal here which terrifies me. We've been trying to move, but everywhere is even more expensive than what we're paying now and we're struggling to save up as almost nothing is left after bills are paid. Crime rate is pretty low and I rarely feel targeted racially as the population mostly seems Hispanic and white, and I get assumed to be Hispanic quite often. Disability access is so-so which is discouraging because there are a lot of places I can't go if I need my chair that day. Transportation is miserable. 100% need a car unless going on the Metra (train), but then you would need a car anywhere except Chicago. Suburbia here is really isolating. I don't have local friends because I'm unable to go places to meet people or hang out with anyone I do meet. My mental health has gotten way worse, and there are very few resources I am able to utilize either due to transportation or cost."
18 - 19,0.70%,"all_R_2PALNgs7ZhX8EjP : I am physically isolated from my peer groups, particularly my queer and jewish peers, because I live in a rural and conservative community. Even before quarantine I rarely got to see other queer or Jewish people in person. The trans support group I participate in is a 45 minute drive from my house, and I haven't belonged to a Jewish congregation since our family synagogue dissolved ten years ago. I am lucky in that my small rural town has a medical specialist who i can see for my chronic illness. Most of my friends live at least 20 minutes away; my romantic partner lives an hour away and that makes it difficult to see them outside of planned dates/outings."
20,0.79%,"all_R_WpMku8nCdcdNpct : I have spent my life hiding most of my disability from others and being emotionally neglected when I did express a need for accommodation. I didnÉ??t have my Autism diagnosis until I was an adult which made me more susceptible to harassment. My peers physically assaulted me for being different more times than I count. My first memory of expressing my gender was met with assault by a classmate, I was 8. It is normalized to bully in this area, a part of the social norms. When I came out about my identity in high school, I had major backlash including being abandoned by my entire support system. The area where I live makes me fear living as my genuine self. My disability stops me from leaving. I need care and support and canÉ??t hold a job. I feel stuck."
21 - 23,0.42%,"all_R_qWQXLdq4SUozeX7 : I live in a basement apartment in a relatively affluent area. Crime is low, pollution is low, my housing is stable as are my finances. I am extremely close with my family, but my parents and sister live about 2 hours away and I cannot see them as much as I would like. My core group of friends also live about 2 hours away now, so I also have a difficult time not seeing them as well."

28 - 31,1.49%,"all_R_33y7fErlUzWVaDF : My place of residence, WÅrzburg, had a negative impact on me in my first semester and thus my first few weeks there. I was depressed, didn&amp;#39;t want to get out of bed, and was constantly tired. The beginning was difficult. Everything was new. Everything was gray (due to the winter). You had to adapt to the new environment. The roommates, their living styles and the student-being-there. My family, friends and my boyfriend are all spread out in Germany. So I can&amp;#39;t really do justice to anyone when it comes to visits. I felt very much at home with my friend. But I didn&amp;#39;t have any friends there either. Only the friends of my friend are there who rejected me or did not understand my behavior. Emotionally I was very wavering. Sometimes turned up, sometimes depressed. After a while when I started doing something with people I became more open and cheerful again. There was no contact with other people (my people). Making your own contacts is very important. Now I was really looking forward to the summer semester. Everything becomes colorful and warm. I wanted to do more. Start my hobby again. Concentrate on myself and experience Wurzburg and accept and get to know my new home. Only now the corona virus came and everything seems to be getting more complicated again. The positive is that you can come to rest. Let&amp;#39;s see what time brings us. I am positive. However, I hardly spend any time in WÅrzburg at the moment."
32,0.71%,"all_R_1fdP92YYd4NfRSg : Place of residence: just moved, gives me warmth and security, peace. I enjoy that we have a big gate to safety and a garden where the dog can play. Due to the size and number of rooms, my partner is almost only in his room. It makes me feel alone. We moved further away from my mother, I miss her. Spatially, it&amp;#39;s great here and much quieter than in the old apartment. But I miss the proximity to the Elbe. Identity: sometimes I feel too much like a housewife who is only there for the Lord. Has given up on himself and, in addition to studying, has to run the household and take responsibility for the dog, since the man goes to work and is therefore completely busy."
33,0.41%,"all_R_3Gm4ZJGvmwwKflr : My current place of residence gives freedom that was not even possible at my previous place of residence. I feel really at home here for the first time. The anonymity of the big city and the social pressure to perform, as well as the lack of commitment in social encounters, which are typical for my milieu, make it difficult for me to build long-term, deep bonds with others."
34,0.35%,"all_R_1JUUwcKlaH7Dml2 : Since I live in a small, almost isolated village, I feel safe there. My relationships are more likely to have a negative impact, as I am difficult to reach by public transport and cannot stay in the city for long in the evenings because the trains don&amp;#39;t travel that long. My health is not affected by where I live."
35,0.41%,"all_R_3noz6tF9lQmNvq4 : Place of residence affects relationships negatively, as does the job in the service of Germany. This also has a negative impact on the character in relation to relationships, but very positively in relation to the career. However, this only has a negative effect at the current place of residence, as there is nothing here to which this could be applied. A move is being planned."
36,0.25%,all_R_290a5bVaWOzssKr : I live here because this is my place of work. I don&amp;#39;t know any people here and I have no friends in this place. It is only a means to an end. My apartment is neither an oasis of wellbeing nor a place of retreat.
37,0.29%,"all_R_1o6WAHXNQ4aIkIE : My family (I currently live with my mother, my parents are separated) pulls me down a lot because I don&amp;#39;t feel perceived as a man. However, I am very satisfied with my geographic location and I feel safe here. Only relationships with a few people limit me."
38,0.33%,"all_R_beaUTKovfG5wWhr : I feel safe. Sometimes safe. Relations with the family partly close (same house) partly very far away (Thuringia, Saxony). Relationships with friends only in neighboring towns, not accessible on foot. Shops can be reached on foot, doctors and university can only be reached by public transport or car."
39,1.27%,"all_R_3qvrnabXdVAjlx8 : I&amp;#39;m in a long-distance relationship and live alone in a one-room apartment. On the one hand it gives me a kind of security to come home in the evening and to know that the place belongs only to me and that I can take as much peace and time for myself as I want here. I don&amp;#39;t have to justify myself with anything or anyone and can decide everything by myself. On the other hand, I am alone here with my thoughts and cannot speak to anyone. Living alone sometimes gives me too much time to think, which sometimes makes me nervous and unsettled. Sometimes it makes me isolate myself from others. I like to live in a city that offers all the advantages of a city, but is small enough that it feels homely and you can sometimes recognize strangers on the bus. I live 1 1/2 hours away from my original home and my family. Just far enough to live away from home and still be able to visit often enough. Sometimes I would rather live in the country. The city is sometimes oppressive. You can never escape for a moment and you can never take a break. Everything is always moving and loud and the air is so suffocating and dirty at times. I love my balcony, but even there it&amp;#39;s too loud to switch off without headphones."
