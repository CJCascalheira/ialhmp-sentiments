This it's difficult to cultivate strong interpersonal relationships, but not impossible. With regard to mental health, it's also difficult to physically find a confidant.

52,0.65%,"all_R_5v8dCpffvnADLdD : While technically I live in a ""ghetto"", I've never really felt the fear that ""should"" come along with it. While crime is higher than it is in other neighbourhoods, it's quite understood that if you respect other people and don't go meddling around in their business, they'll treat you the same way. Honestly, living where I live coupled with the people around me (although I cannot consider my family to be poor) has probably skewed me in the direction of disdain for the rich and societal wealth gaps."
53,0.44%,"all_R_2sYEAh4zG6Oe8QY : I don???t necessarily live in a ???bad??ù area, but it???s not completely safe. The homeless population is high and the drug use is high as well.

54,0.20%,all_R_27jOpMS0hVDb5GG : where i live is a safe place. I grew up in this area so I have close relationships with people in the area due to middleschool/highschool.
55 - 56,0.75%,"all_R_1r2rEuOdrpv1ji3 : My location is what is known as the ghetto. There are often police cars around, but we only sometimes know why. It makes me fearful for my safety, especially walking home alone at night. Often, the glass in our lobby will be broken, either from someone trying to get in or maybe a fight. That makes me worried that someone unknown is in the building and it's not like we have cameras for our safety. I am close by to my doctor, my workplace and my school so the area is not that bad. I live with my parents so I see my family every day, making our relationships in a good place."

61,1.03%,"all_R_1hB8H9XKvxuc48M : Scarborough is known in Toronto for being one of the less secure areas, however, personally, I find Sherbourne to be the Mordor of Toronto(I.E It freaks me out to go there). I don't think the air in Toronto is particularly clean. All these industrial factories are polluting the air. Relationships in Toronto are the worst. You have to be a 7/10 or higher to find a relationship without unbearable difficulty. However, Toronto still is the best environment for me considering financial supports, health supports, and overall social help. The only place I would rather live in is England. As for my identity, I'm largely a product of colonialism as arguably most people are today. Honestly, I think I have identity issues and sometimes can decide what I identify as(depending on the sort of identity."

64,0.81%,"all_R_2ru6Yt4mj4I15Jb : Certain geographic locations can identify the socioeconomic status of an individual. For example, an area with many amenities such as malls, restaurants, hospitals, etc. would most likely include residents with a higher socioeconomic status than an area with a lot of poverty. Living in a country like Canada, which is a first world country, and a neighbourhood that is surrounded by the essentials and more, it makes my life a lot easier and privileged. Health and safety wise, I live in an area where crime is low, security is high, hospitals are just minutes away and friends/family are a short drive or public transit ride away."

70,0.40%,"all_R_3NI0FJgBAdayqaJ : Canada to me is a safe and open country. Being far up in the north means that the weather is generally cold. The cold weather discourages me from going outside, which can be a negative influence on my health. Other than this, I don't think that the geographical location has a big influence on me."

87 - 88,1.47%,"all_R_xzS9fYToU82qVy1 : So I live in a neighborhood that is constantly presumed as a dangerous place but in my option, bad things happen everywhere. It's been over a year since I was almost robbed by 3 kids around my age right in front of my own house, this was a month after moving from one part of my community to another. This made me feel really unsafe because I could have died that day but I managed to get away even though these people had a knife pointed at me. The part that had me really concerned about my safety was that there were people nearby getting into a car who decided to pay no attention. After this, I walked on the opposite side of the street for months. Don't get me wrong growing up in this community was the absolute best even though we didn't enough money to do all the things kids had the opportunity to do we still made it fun. Growing up gay in a community predominately black people it was hard to come to terms with who I was because of a lot of negative stigma and bullying towards LGBTQ+ people. But as a child, I'd always look forward to the community barbeques because that's when the best of people would come out, everyone was treated like family."

I've had people tell me that I would not need OSAP because I live in Markham, when in fact, I needed a lot more than my peers that live in, for example, Scarborough. I am pretty safe in Markham as robberies and shootings here are minimal, my health is also okay for the most part, but mentally, I am not well."
92,0.30%,"all_R_28ZqkUedkvCaQip : My location impacts myself because of all the violence that takes place in the city, I feel my health to be fine also as well as my relationships because my location does not really impact that for me personally."

104,0.68%,"all_R_26c2KlhAwUPGGHb : Honestly, I don't think that my location has any impacts on my safety since I live in a quiet place. The same applies to my health since we have really good healthcare and it is required for everyone to have insurance so I don't think that's an issue either.

In Merced, California I feel more safe than I would if I were staying at the house I grew up in back home in Stockton, California and that is simply due to the large difference in crime rates within these two locations.

When it comes to my health it's great, but it's when that changes that It may be a problem because I have the school's health insurance so I don't know if it's accepted everywhere. Being in a city, rather than a more quiet, open land is that there is always something going on and there's more opportunity for distraction and avoiding deeper conversations."

My cousin was affected by this and lost his family, job, and life. he has been in jail four times and he is still trying to chnage his life. For hispanic families its normal to have someone in jail. This is normal ofr until it comes to deportating family members. over all I think Garden Grove is a great place to live there is not much violence and I feel safe where I live in whereas, Santa Ana or Anahiem those cities have the worst safety. Those are considr the party hard, drugs, get drunk, and probably get shot or killed.

There is access to health facilities which makes it easy for people to seek medical attention if needed. The only downside would be that because it is a small town, relationships matter in the way that there are 3 or 4 high schools and most people know or have heard of each other so there's this implied ""reputation"" to uphold because things spread easily. This can be harmful in the way that if there are bad rumors being spread this can cause bullying or shaming."

I live around a lot of orchards so they can bring peace sometimes. I was robbed a few years ago so since then it has been tough feeling safe, but we also have a security system now I feel safer.

My hometown is right next to the capital of the state (it's only a 10 min drive) so I have access to any resources that I would need for both mental and physical health. Since I don't live in the city I feel safe, even when I am in the city I have never felt unsafe. The Springfield Police Department does a good job of keeping everyone safe.

Primarily Bergen County is a higher class and white town so I feel that safety and health was not much of a concern growing up. There are many emergency expresses near by and other services that are easily accessible. The towns police and departments are always out patrolling. The only time I felt unsafe was when my familys home had a fire a couple years ago and was displaced for months. This was because we had to move and learn new ways of getting around and was sort of thrown outside of our comfort zone.

My home is in between two apartment buildings so I rarely get the chance to know my neighbors and don't really care to at this point. There are a lot of businesses and stores nearby which allow the possibility of break-ins and robberies as they have happened before. One of the suspects has cut through my back yard one in attempt to run away from police. My health is okay but I often despise my home and think it discourages me by the way it looks inside and all the responsibility I taken on by myself. All I ever do when I am home, is sit in my room."

I never felt unsafe walking to the local town or biking to my workplace. I do feel isolated from my peers as i live very far from my current school. This strains my relationships with friends as i have to rely on calling and facetime when i need someone to talk to.

37 - 39,0.37%,zero_R_1onA35tvArg0SLM : The area I live in is very busy and loud all the time so it becomes background noise for me. It did make it harder to hang out with friends due to it being unsafe to cross the road alone before they put in more stop signs and traffic lights

98 - 101,1.22%,"zero_R_ZmiywjObddFV5qF : My relationships are positively influenced by my place of residence because our place is a bit smaller and you can spontaneously meet friends / acquaintances differently than in big cities. I also see my security higher with us, especially in relation to break-ins, theft and violence because this is only minimal with us and if you do then you know the &amp;quot;bad roads&amp;quot; and avoid them. My personal development and diversity is limited by my place of residence because here you definitely stand out if you are something ? ? ?different? ? doesn? ? ? t matter whether you are figure, character, etc. Because I have complexities with my figure despite having a normal build I feel the pressure here in Coburg is significantly greater than in larger cities.

Due to the Covid-19 situation, I moved the 400km back to my home, as I have several foster care cases and high-risk patients in the family who my brother and I support. This also means that the visit from my life partner is no longer necessary. The distance puts a strain on the relationship, but I will move away from emden and after our studies are over we will see. I feel safe in all three places. I don&amp;#39;t regret the decision to change my place of residence due to my studies. Emden is a very pleasant city. It&amp;#39;s big enough but not a big city. Everything is on site and everything can be reached on foot or by bike. The only thing that is a shame is the poor networking of the buses.

In addition, because my mom is a nurse and we live close to the city I have access to pretty good medical resources. I have not found any difficulty dealing with my gender and/or my identity, primarily because I don't belong to the LGBTQ+ organization, and society is more welcoming to individuals who are heterosexual or identify as a male or female compared to those who are lesbian or gay. In addition, because of that I believe that I am more comfortable going about society, whereas others may be ridiculed in his or her workspace, church, or home.

Being able to live in the United Kingdom means that I get access to the basic necessities of life which ensures my safety, shelter, food and water. I have no complaints about my location in that regard. However it can also be said that living in London, the capital of England, which is a city rich with multicultural sights and people it is very easy for someone of all aspects of their identity to be accepted, including myself. I feel perfectly comfortable residing here and I doubt that all locations will grant me such a luxury."
13,0.93%,"all_R_2Cea9uKUqFqDgtg : I feel like I was lucky, growing up privileged growing up in an environment where I never lacked anything and always had people around. I therefore never faced challenges that a part of the population does face, there was always support on all aspects. Still, it came with its own set of challenges. The need for success at all cost came from a very high pressure from family and school but it has toughed me up and made me adverse in front all challenges, but it has also distanced me from a lot of issues, meaning I can look at issues sometimes from a very cold and distant perspective. Even if I don't have any complicated relation with sexuality or identity, I know this would have been a problem in my family coming from a privileged catholic background. In general term I was very lucky and had access to health services and always felt safe."

Although I'm very happy with my campus life which is very easy access through bus the living situation I believe can be improved the biggest issue I have is safety all the buildings are old and anyone ca just walk in. Although I'm getting all the resources water wifi kitchen furniture etc I feel maintenance and sanitation is very poor. I go to college and after that work so I don't have a lot of time to focus on it myself but someone should.

I think because I am female sometimes I feel unsafe alone in areas of high crime which is sad in the least, but for the most part I am lucky enough to have grown up in an area where crime was decently low, therefore I rarely felt unsafe in my environment.

The city in and of itself is pretty modern and open with their inclusivity which is especially celebrated with their yearly weekend long LGBTQ parade/festival.

And a general feeling of fuck, because of long periods with unemployment and inability to find something worthwhile. A do not worry about my safety ect. In regards to my gender(cis woman) or attraction(pan). I can at the most expect a ""what?"" From people that don't know what pan is. Other people are less privileged than me, but in general we have it good. I am obese, and once in a while a have to insist in the Healthcare system, because they often go to ""well it would get better if you lose weight"" but I get Healthcare. And most of it is free, so I have no economic problems with having to insist sometimes. The treatment for my depression is also basically free, I think i spend around 20 dollars a month on medication. So all in all, even though I probably score quite bad in most of this.

My life would be miserable without them because my family doesn't understand. I'm going to admit here that I'm starting to consider myself Agender but I don't know if I'd ever admit that to my family because my asexuality already makes me a joke.

Gender and sexuality are rarely acknowledged by people I???m not close friends with already, and I???ve faced a good deal of harassment and discrimination, mostly at work, because of my gender here.

46,0.85%,"all_R_SICoju41jYsZE9b : I live in the south and it hasn???t exactly been easy. Though I currently live in a more open minded part of our city, I had to leave my old job because of harassment after I came out on Facebook. I wasn???t fired, but the harassment was poorly handled enough that I no longer felt like I could stay on. I was lucky enough to have something else lined up, but it???s still been difficult. If I didn???t live with a partner right now I would probably be homeless or in danger of being homeless. I was booted off of my mom???s insurance and although I desperately need mental health care (I have PTSD, GAD, and depression) I can???t afford it and access has been especially difficult with everything else going on. I don???t know what things are like elsewhere but it definitely doesn???t help to live in a southern state."
47,2.86%,"all_R_3qNJFXcpF4ypx4n : Please consider that some of the phrasing of the survey and the image used to present the survey (the map filled with flags and other images) are somewhat problematic and offensive. For a group studying minority status as an impact in mental health, both your phrasing of minority issues and mental health issues is concerning. The phrasing ""Mentally unwell"" and ""Emotional disabled"" were confusing and don't really describe anything in particular. Would a person with an emotional illness, like Bipolar Disorder, be considered ""mentally unwell"" AND ""emotionally disabled?"" BPD is a disability under the DSM V, but I imagine may would ""self-identify"" as ""mentally unwell."" It just wasn't clear to me. Another offensive question was the one about suicide attempts. It came out of nowhere, and is likely triggering for a number of participants/potential participants. There was no warning in the consent form before the survey to talk about those issues, and no questions about a history of self-harm, or other examples of ways mental illness presents itself physically (e.g. eating disorders). Additionally on the long form page about family/friends/co-workers and whether sexual orientation is visible, two or three of the options were off the page and not even clickable. So I wanted to put N/A for some of them and simply could not. Your survey also seemed to teeter between focusing on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity as minorities, and Racial and/or Ethnic Identity. Those are two very large and complex areas of research on their own (as four, independent areas of research). I feel very strongly, as an academic myself completing research currently on Critical Race Theory, that you are not gaining anything of actual substance from the survey you've launched. Overall your language and imagery is questionable at best for a group of academics, and I'm disappointed. You may want to add some trigger warning(s) to the consent page. Also you may want to add to your consent page that this survey is not IRB Approved. If it were, you would have stated it. Now to answer this actual question: As a multiracial, multiethnic, Cis-Hetero woman, I feel location plays an overt role in my relationships and my access to resources. The ability to be as educated as I am is a privilege, and places me in a socio-economic class that also directly impacts the same. Living in Connecticut, there is an abundance of wealth and a higher standard of living than where I grew up in the South. I feel much safer here than in some of the urban areas I've lived in the past, and I feel racism, sexism, and homophobia are far less common here in New England than they were in the South. That isn't to say it doesn't all exist, because it does. It is just much less blatant in the North East than it is in the South."
48,0.86%,"all_R_20ZsRh8jYlOgPTx : I live in a very conservative area which can make it difficult to find places where I will be accepted. I had to leave a church because of that, found a new one after a few years and a lot of grief, I currently work at a progressive place that in theory accepts trans people but I???ve encountered an amount of transphobia from coworkers. I want to find another place to work but I???m just so worried about how they will deal with me being trans. Passing isn???t a thing for non-binary people so going stealth isn???t an option. If I ever want to be accepted for who I am I have to out myself. My parents love me but I know they don???t think what I???m doing is right. They???re conservative Christians. I???m thankful we have the relationship we do but it makes me sad that they don???t understand or accept me for who I am."

53 - 54,0.66%,all_R_6tVhN8MZMFwGKzL : I moved from a fairly liberal state to Arizona within the past year. Seeing the differences in how Minnesota is dealing with the COVID 19 epidemic in comparison to Arizona has really affected my mental health. I do not feel safe here but I am stuck here until I finish my PhD. I want to leave this place as soon as possible but this is my ancestral home and I feel bound to improving this place because it's where I belong. There is a lot of tension here. I do not feel as safe identifying as Bisexual. I do not feel as safe identifying as polyamorous. I definitely do not feel safe idenifying as Xicanx. I don't feel safe here.
55,0.21%,all_R_x4PFo4c47zwOPIJ : I live rurally and therefore do not have the stress and anxiety for daily safety some transwomen do. Also being married for over 20 years my wife is always there if any issue arises.
56,0.82%,"all_R_3iVG9N6MYTSEBib : The high degree of conformaty present in Utah also manages to create an environment in which counterculture groups provide meaningful touchstones for non-conforming persons. I have found that the SM community is quite dedicated and valued amongst its members. I have been largely isolated from the BDSM community in the months of Covid-19 precaution and that absence has negatively impacted my health and self worth. The prevailing religion is also a cultural force. When I worked for a Mormon organization, my outgroup status made me feel extremely devalued. It's hard to avoid that feeling in this state. I have a lot to say about how unsafe I feel in this state, how my childhood was fraught with rejection and sadness and how those thoughts persist. Thank you for doing this research."
57,0.80%,"all_R_3KCrbSlvavJ0o1o : the society is sexist and homophobic, very transphobic, the health care system is extremely bad and the government just became a dictatorship that used their power obtained under the guise of covid to make laws against trans people in the first couple of days I work for a big international organization so my situation is better than most people in this country. However I do not feel save in the current situation because I do not believe the government cares about its citizens in the slightest and because the health care system is so catastrophic (due to corruption based underfunding) that I am afraid to not leave the hospital alive should I get admitted. But I guess at least we all have health insurance as its still europe so thats a plus sorry Illinois"
58,0.41%,"all_R_2t36qEYTXr0izeZ : Living in Texas, even in San Antonio, isn't safe for the trans community. Last week, a transwoman was stabbed to death because ""god sent this guy"" to kill her. I live 5,000 miles away from my husband, one of my biggest sources of social support. I have some support here, but living away from my husband has a massive negative impact on my emotional well-being and overall stability."
59,0.40%,"all_R_2dTlczEjzzIDL1Q : Very few folks around here are anything but white, christian, and straight. Being a queer transwoman who semi-follows a non-abrahamic faith I don't fit in, at all. 95% of the time this is fine, the other 5% is where you get some bigotry shining out. I've never been physically attacked in this area, but I've certainly been treated as less than human due to being trans."
60,1.91%,"all_R_2eXBZZiMB0KLL6F : Im an FTM transgender who live in the less open minded side of israel. I rarely go out of home and stuck with no job for 2 years now. My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything, Since than im kind of really scared of people. So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it. A dream. Im sure thats also illusion. And that theres no really safe space anywhere ."

63,0.95%,"all_R_wOa1YKmNZsi5uIp : Job security is pretty minimal here which terrifies me. We've been trying to move, but everywhere is even more expensive than what we're paying now and we're struggling to save up as almost nothing is left after bills are paid. Crime rate is pretty low and I rarely feel targeted racially as the population mostly seems Hispanic and white, and I get assumed to be Hispanic quite often. Disability access is so-so which is discouraging because there are a lot of places I can't go if I need my chair that day. Transportation is miserable. 100% need a car unless going on the Metra (train), but then you would need a car anywhere except Chicago. Suburbia here is really isolating. I don't have local friends because I'm unable to go places to meet people or hang out with anyone I do meet. My mental health has gotten way worse, and there are very few resources I am able to utilize either due to transportation or cost."
64,0.69%,"all_R_3oU7Q5HySwZzMN2 : I live in a predominantly conservative town/county, and I am a progressive, leftist individual. While mental health is preached about in government, realistically there are very few resources accessible and appropriate for me, and ever fewer available that would feel appropriate for minorities. I am relatively safe, compared to other countries - and definitely safe compared to minorities within this area. There is healthcare easily accessible (normally, right now during the pandemic things are limited) While altogether I am safe, and able to access some resources, this is an area where mental health issues are viewed as nonsense by the general public."
65,0.24%,"all_R_21B1fhzbngAlgky : I moved to my location specifically to feel safer in living as an out, non-stealth trans person. I have not regretted my decision at all and it has significantly improved my mental health and feeling of safety."
66,0.52%,"all_R_3ekPkHBnZqWBnzi : I believe my location does impact me; I have a plethora of food options, banking services, and medical professionals located very close by. It is a high-traffic neighbourhood with both residential and professional buildings, and a school, so it is active on both weekdays and weekends. Most importantly, I live on the same block as a subway station, so I have freedom of mobility (when the outside is safe). This all means that I have access to food and can see my friends without much issue."
67 - 68,0.57%,all_R_25FsXA8W6Wym7QW : I live in a mostly republican neighborhood. most times people try to respect my pronouns and identity but I've had people tell me straight to my face they could never call me a man because I dont look like one. I also have been shoulder checked for walking around the town fair and looking the way I do. For the most part I feel safe in my own home but my partner worries about me having pride stickers on my car or on display on our porch. Recently though things have gotten easier because the facemasks hide my more effeminate features.
69,0.21%,"all_R_10vCj4X6RfEOK2P : Philly is a good place for queer people generally (gayborhood, city programs have options for minority gender identities, outfest and pride both openly celebrated) but I'm not safe here."
70,0.72%,"all_R_3qJpXiYh2KaKGKo : I used to live in the American South (NC &amp; VA), and was deeply impoverished. Even with a welcoming, close friendship group, life was very hard. I have since moved to rural northern Illinois. While it's not perfect, my life is much better for having the political support of a blue state. Things like unions, easier employment, and more money overall have directly helped my safety and security. I also experience a lot more places of business and state agencies that have sexuality and gender identity as protected classes written into their foundational documents, and it shows. Even with something as simple as getting a haircut (present pandemic excluded) is so much better now."

Due to the size and number of rooms, my partner is almost only in his room. It makes me feel alone. We moved further away from my mother, I miss her. Spatially, it&amp;#39;s great here and much quieter than in the old apartment. But I miss the proximity to the Elbe. Identity: sometimes I feel too much like a housewife who is only there for the Lord.
