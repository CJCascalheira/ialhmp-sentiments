49,1.55%,"all_R_3kGKEl33LxksxsF : There's this music genre and community coined as ""midwest emos"" and I think most people who have grown up in the midwest can agree to feeling depressed a lot of the time, especially when they're further away from bigger cities. A lot of the time it feels really isolated and lonely, even when you're surrounded by your friends. There's this sort of eeriness that comes with living here that you can't really shake. My location has lead to me to not report a rape because I wouldn't be able to afford all of the things that come along with it. My life feels very in the middle, but I know I have it better than a lot of people still, and that's even more depressing. The midwest sucks, but it also grants freedoms you don't really get anywhere else. Sitting on the roof of your car, stargazing with no one around you for miles can be leave you feeling really connected to the earth. Those moments make life worth something, it makes all the death threats for fighting for who you are and what you believe in worthwhile. It takes time to realize these things though, and I'm really grateful that I did. There's still a lot of things that could be useful for kids living in rural areas, but it isn't all hopeless all of the time."
50,0.15%,all_R_27sseEZ0XK4m8ea : My location makes me feel really good because in my area I am part of the wealthier portion.
51,0.69%,"all_R_2CNTnEiPzHxfzUv : My geographic location is a literal health disparity. I live 25 minutes away from a hospital that is mainly populated by migrant workers who cannot afford health insurance or access it. It's rough out here, but things could be worse. I think the best way to describe it is as a place we all hope to get away from, but I still love the country aspect of it. It's not all bad, but it's also not all good. It's very small and I (and many others, such as my friends) are looking to leave one day for at least a couple of years or so."
52,0.28%,all_R_2VwGfU3wIjn04am : I am thankful to live somewhere where I can have all of my necessities to keep me going during these hard times. I have a girlfriend who goes to Pace with me but lives and Miami and we miss each other.

54,0.43%,"all_R_1FailUrSZd2G6TY : Near my home, there are many health resources available. My friends are a few streets away which helps when we get together in person. My family and I are renting from a close uncle which helps me feel safe and unafraid of losing the home. Also, because I am with my family, I am able to build on my relationships with them."
55,0.89%,"all_R_33apbMI2XORbfMS : Well, I have grown up in a very middle class area and there are many towns surrounding me that are extremely wealthy or poor. My highschool was very large with a graduating class of 1,000 students and with the school being split into two campuses. So, I like to think I experienced lots of diversity in highschool and got to see other's lives around me and I don't like to take mine for granted. My sexual identity was always a question because I always knew since I little girl that I could date boys but never knew I could date girls until older. So the idea of dating girls was kind of crossed out in my mind because I had been conditioned ""I like boys"" but I didn't know I could like both."
56,0.48%,"all_R_2ahsq9eQb6kFjRS : I think my geographic location compared to many others in the world has helped my safety, health, and relationships. I have grown up in the middle class, with no real complaints. Went to descent schools, got the education needed to get me to a 4 year university, I have many friends both back home and in Merced, and my safety has never been in question either."
57,0.10%,all_R_1MLGUR5PoXfNOa7 : The location is pretty safe since is close to school.
58,0.24%,all_R_22lEjqRz3fmuQ3v : I believe my geographic location does impact me. I live in a small conservative town. Most people here are very welcoming and my neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.
59,0.48%,"all_R_3kce9mlMPcqC5qm : Location impacts almost all aspects of my life. In Merced, California I feel more safe than I would if I were staying at the house I grew up in back home in Stockton, California and that is simply due to the large difference in crime rates within these two locations. Merced feels more calm whereas in Stockton you need to be aware of your surroundings more often."
60,0.60%,"all_R_7PZBao8Fmu1CxMJ : I'm in the US, in San Fernando, based on where I am I can say that, for the most part, it's pretty safe. When it comes to my health it's great, but it's when that changes that It may be a problem because I have the school's health insurance so I don't know if it's accepted everywhere. Being in a city, rather than a more quiet, open land is that there is always something going on and there's more opportunity for distraction and avoiding deeper conversations."
61,0.43%,all_R_sSbqKU122HL090Z : The central valley compared to other regions is fairly isolated and sometimes I feel like I can't really have fun here or out go to places. Due to it being less crowded has made me appreciate nature and calms me. Relationship wise its difficult meeting people with my same mind set to it being an are fairly conservative.
62,0.12%,all_R_3CCLijaDhsJBN1I : There's not a lot of access to resources but that is considering COVID.
63,0.59%,"all_R_3KVDHzM7IyrAw88 : I live sort of in the country so I don't have as many neighbors as the typical person who lives in the city. I live around a lot of orchards so they can bring peace sometimes. I was robbed a few years ago so since then it has been tough feeling safe, but we also have a security system now I feel safer. The biggest health problem is that I have asthma and theres a lot of dirt and pollen by my house so it can be a bit tough to breathe sometimes."
64,0.54%,"all_R_1N4IosedMZVeNOK : My location plays a small role on the impact it has on me because it still allows me to have access to resources such as hospitals, clinics, school, etc. My location feels safe and does not make me feel like I am posed with a threat to my own safety or well being. This location is also small which allows for easy access to my friends and family, enabling the relationships I have to be consistent and well."
65 - 66,0.38%,all_R_3elDbQKWIQipnKp : I live in a ranch. I live with my in laws and my fianc??. I love living here because its pretty big to where I can drive all the way to the back of my backyard. I like taking walks and enjoying the fresh air when I can. we have animals too that are calming. I like the open areas.
01-Feb,0.30%,zero_R_3J3i4bamR9nke5z : I live near a very established location where I am about 15 minutes from everything I need. I think it makes a big difference being close to everything that I could need on my quality of life.
03-Jun,0.46%,"zero_R_37AQRVSkhJHl1jr : My location has a huge effect on me as a person because I have access to many things that others don't. Since I was raised in a nicer area with parents who can afford it, I didn't learn until I was older how lucky I was to be raised like that and how hard other people work to get less than what I have."
07-Aug,0.15%,zero_R_O7nE5cD31QAgLYt : I am very close to the student health and wellness center if I ever needed anything.

Dec-14,0.75%,"zero_R_10CmPcuCDGmAckV : My geographic location both at SIU and back home are good. My hometown is right next to the capital of the state (it's only a 10 min drive) so I have access to any resources that I would need for both mental and physical health. Since I don't live in the city I feel safe, even when I am in the city I have never felt unsafe. The Springfield Police Department does a good job of keeping everyone safe. SIU does a good job of providing for all of our needs as well. They also do a good job of keeping us safe on campus."
15,0.24%,zero_R_3lLyTcVtnnQRC9i : I live in a good suburb of St. Louis where I have a lot of friends. I never really have to fear for my safety when I am out and about in the area.
16,0.50%,"zero_R_2bhNnN9dMchncVb : My location impacts me because I believe, who and what you are surrounded with will effect your every day life. Where I live is in a middle class happy place. I believe your location can change the way you see things and how you act for example if you grew up in the hood you may get involved with drugs because you grew up with that."
17 - 20,1.03%,"zero_R_23dTFGhgDcGbMjD : I grew up and still live in a suburban town mixed with people of all classes and races. Primarily Bergen County is a higher class and white town so I feel that safety and health was not much of a concern growing up. There are many emergency expresses near by and other services that are easily accessible. The towns police and departments are always out patrolling. The only time I felt unsafe was when my familys home had a fire a couple years ago and was displaced for months. This was because we had to move and learn new ways of getting around and was sort of thrown outside of our comfort zone. Other then that, I personally have never felt a significant negative impact on my safety, health, or relationships."
21,0.20%,"zero_R_vdwoG5GNqyQs493 : I grew up in a fairly safe neighborhood, as a white kid In a primarily white town I never felt discriminated against."

31 - 33,0.29%,"zero_R_2YswRDZ0G3Gl5HB : Since I live in the capital of Greece, Athens I have access to very many different places; nit only regarding my job and medical issues, but also based on my friendships and night outs."
34 - 37,0.52%,"zero_R_umLl8F0Pow7pDj3 : I live in wealthy country by all global standards and have been a successful executive, father and citizen (by all reasonable measures).

I have access to good healthcare, good family and friend relationships but can sometimes feel isolated."
38 - 39,1.87%,"zero_R_2rPCP3AwSSZfMhU : I grew up in the rural mountains of North Carolina. While I now attend medical school and have had a solid socioeconomic standing while growing up. My school and community was severely underserved. The community does not hold many of the important specialties, especially when concerning pediatric care. More so, mental health initiatives and counseling help is extremely limited in the area and can lead to challenges throughout the community. For example, I was required to travel close to 200 miles round trip in order to receive treatment for a pediatric bleeding disorder as a child. The closest PICU is the same distance and has led to significant challenges for both my family and even more throughout the community. Emergency medicine is the highest risk in the area as transport can lead to poor health outcomes, particularly due tot he isolation associated with the community. The areas tobacco and drug problems are a extremely significant as well, as a result of previous tobacco industry in the area, lack of resources to mental and physical health, poor education system, and low socioeconomic status. Watauga county has the largest socioeconomic disparity in the state of N.C. this translates to a food insecurity rate approaching 25-33%, an astounding number. This further complicates health in the region."
40 - 41,0.47%,zero_R_2OTKpA81uFXlJSQ : I don't know that my location affects this much other than the good fortune of living in a first world country (which I do think matters quite a bit). I think it's more impactful that I am well educated and successful professionally giving me financial wherewithal to meet my needs and the needs of those I love.
42 - 43,0.73%,"zero_R_3sgpO2LYjpnLYkK : My location puts me at a disadvantage to communicate with those of other cultural backgrounds. I have been blessed to be put into such a diverse church and university, but apart from those I grew up in a redneck, white town. I live in the middle of no where so it is pretty safe out here. There are disadvantages of wanting to communicate with others in person as I must travel quite a distance to see people. My family also has to drive that length to get groceries as they are not accessible out here."
44 - 45,0.43%,zero_R_2v0QyowjtiZ6jAn : Growing up where I did made me able to keep myself occupied and happy with little to do. Moving to Carbondale has changed what I have access to and made me feel more lethargic and depressed more often. I had more close relationships in my small town than in a larger city like here.

57,0.52%,"zero_R_1n9FsGMeHGni4YG : I live in the suburbs, and I feel this insulates me from many threats to health and safety.

I never felt unsafe walking to the local town or biking to my workplace. I do feel isolated from my peers as i live very far from my current school. This strains my relationships with friends as i have to rely on calling and facetime when i need someone to talk to.

I can go anywhere without limits, I can develop freely, I can enjoy nature. I can ride my bike alone at three o&amp;#39;clock in the morning without fear. My place of residence allows me to have many relationships and to be healthy. Mentally, because I can go to the sea or the forest, geographically, because I can see a doctor when I&amp;#39;m sick.

The fact that many places can be reached on foot is particularly good for my health and encourages me to move around a lot. I have the freedom to move where I want and whenever I want.

This has led me to feel comfortable experimenting with gender and sexuality, but has left me lacking in education on racial issues. I live in a very safe neighborhood and do not experience violence, and it came as quite a shock when I was in a group of people with wildly different lives than me who live through fights at school, violence at home, and can still come out of it nonchalant."
111,1.24%,"all_R_DcwAYA2SpjwiCTD : I live in a pretty safe suburban neighborhood so I guess that would explain why I very rarely felt unsafe in my life. In addition, because my mom is a nurse and we live close to the city I have access to pretty good medical resources. I have not found any difficulty dealing with my gender and/or my identity, primarily because I don't belong to the LGBTQ+ organization, and society is more welcoming to individuals who are heterosexual or identify as a male or female compared to those who are lesbian or gay. In addition, because of that I believe that I am more comfortable going about society, whereas others may be ridiculed in his or her workspace, church, or home. As for my ethnicity, because I am Asian, I have faced some difficulty and racist comments when growing up, but it did not really bother me or stunt my confidence or my appreciation for my culture."

Other than that, the stress I experience at work/school is also immaculate."

117 - 118,0.59%,"all_R_yqq6tYRwjjms1Lr : The location in which I live in has very low crime rate so feeling unsafe has never been a problem. My mother works for my doctor so having availability to healthcare has always been easy as well. I grew up in not the wealthiest family, but we always found a way to make it work. Family and friends were always there if we needed help and we're always there if our friends and family need help."

120,0.83%,"all_R_3KDE3UnwLBYQjlh : It doesn't effect much at all. I don't feel like my location has that large of an impact on me, and maybe that's because I don't think about it very much. It's not something I've given much thought. I have a doctor, and my family is always there to help me if I ever need it, I've never really felt like I had a reason to worry about anything. I've always been able to keep a smile on my face, well, most of the time anyway, and that's what I think is important. I think having a god reason to smile, and having a good reason to be happy, is what makes life truly meaningful."

3,2.86%,"all_R_3qNJFXcpF4ypx4n : Please consider that some of the phrasing of the survey and the image used to present the survey (the map filled with flags and other images) are somewhat problematic and offensive. For a group studying minority status as an impact in mental health, both your phrasing of minority issues and mental health issues is concerning. The phrasing ""Mentally unwell"" and ""Emotional disabled"" were confusing and don't really describe anything in particular. Would a person with an emotional illness, like Bipolar Disorder, be considered ""mentally unwell"" AND ""emotionally disabled?"" BPD is a disability under the DSM V, but I imagine may would ""self-identify"" as ""mentally unwell."" It just wasn't clear to me. Another offensive question was the one about suicide attempts. It came out of nowhere, and is likely triggering for a number of participants/potential participants. There was no warning in the consent form before the survey to talk about those issues, and no questions about a history of self-harm, or other examples of ways mental illness presents itself physically (e.g. eating disorders). Additionally on the long form page about family/friends/co-workers and whether sexual orientation is visible, two or three of the options were off the page and not even clickable. So I wanted to put N/A for some of them and simply could not. Your survey also seemed to teeter between focusing on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity as minorities, and Racial and/or Ethnic Identity. Those are two very large and complex areas of research on their own (as four, independent areas of research). I feel very strongly, as an academic myself completing research currently on Critical Race Theory, that you are not gaining anything of actual substance from the survey you've launched. Overall your language and imagery is questionable at best for a group of academics, and I'm disappointed. You may want to add some trigger warning(s) to the consent page. Also you may want to add to your consent page that this survey is not IRB Approved. If it were, you would have stated it. Now to answer this actual question: As a multiracial, multiethnic, Cis-Hetero woman, I feel location plays an overt role in my relationships and my access to resources. The ability to be as educated as I am is a privilege, and places me in a socio-economic class that also directly impacts the same. Living in Connecticut, there is an abundance of wealth and a higher standard of living than where I grew up in the South. I feel much safer here than in some of the urban areas I've lived in the past, and I feel racism, sexism, and homophobia are far less common here in New England than they were in the South. That isn't to say it doesn't all exist, because it does. It is just much less blatant in the North East than it is in the South."
4,0.73%,"all_R_3k0NqZ04ofivcRe : Living in Britain and being a university student in an accepting department as an queer immigrant with depression and anxiety is definitely helping me feel supported compared to my peers in other parts of the world (America and Romania). I'm also middle class and both my parents have an annual income of &gt;?ú100k so I have medical insurance and can access private therapy at any time and buy medication when I need it. The greatest support has always come from my academic departments (my sixth form high school, university) who accommodate for mental illness and go the extra mile to meet my needs. The NHS long waiting times did lead to a suicide attempt and the counselling provided did not help."

I am lucky in the sense that I have the finances to support all of my ""new"" mental health needs, but part of the reason I was trapped was because I didn't always have the resources to support what I needed to escape and recover from the fallout."

9,1.91%,"all_R_2eXBZZiMB0KLL6F : Im an FTM transgender who live in the less open minded side of israel. I rarely go out of home and stuck with no job for 2 years now. My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything, Since than im kind of really scared of people. So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it.

11,0.95%,"all_R_wOa1YKmNZsi5uIp : Job security is pretty minimal here which terrifies me. We've been trying to move, but everywhere is even more expensive than what we're paying now and we're struggling to save up as almost nothing is left after bills are paid. Crime rate is pretty low and I rarely feel targeted racially as the population mostly seems Hispanic and white, and I get assumed to be Hispanic quite often. Disability access is so-so which is discouraging because there are a lot of places I can't go if I need my chair that day. Transportation is miserable. 100% need a car unless going on the Metra (train), but then you would need a car anywhere except Chicago. Suburbia here is really isolating. I don't have local friends because I'm unable to go places to meet people or hang out with anyone I do meet.
