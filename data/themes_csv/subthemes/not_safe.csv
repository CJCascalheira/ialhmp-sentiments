I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything,  Since than im kind of really scared of people.  So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own.

all_R_2ypvM84uSO2Zqr7    :,Well I don't live in the safest environment. This morning a teenage girl close to my age was kidnapped and yanked from her mothers arms. This happened very close to my location so it makes me feel very uneasy about my surroundings.

The city is stimulating and inspiring, however It could have its downsides too, depending on its districts, in which safety is an apparent issue. I believe that is the case in every metropolitan city."

all_R_32XAOYZoWaNGPpU    :,I've been living in at evergreen terrace apartment for a month now and I have a mixed feeling about it. Although I'm very happy with my campus life which is very easy access through bus the living situation I believe can be improved the biggest issue I have is safety all the buildings are old and anyone ca just walk in. Although I'm getting all the resources water wifi kitchen furniture etc I feel maintenance and sanitation is very poor. I go to college and after that work so I don't have a lot of time to focus on it myself but someone should. The community seems nice though all types of people are living here so a lot of diverse families live here and students live I have spoken to not a lot of people here but the ones I met seem nice and look like a cooperative neighborhood.

ItÉ??s not very safe either compared to the seaside town I used to live in, there is lots of council estates and gangs which hang round from what IÉ??ve seen."
