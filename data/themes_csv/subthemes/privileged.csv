all_R_3qNJFXcpF4ypx4n    :,"Please consider that some of the phrasing of the survey and the image used to present the survey (the map filled with flags and other images) are somewhat problematic and offensive. For a group studying minority status as an impact in mental health, both your phrasing of minority issues and mental health issues is concerning. The phrasing ""Mentally unwell"" and ""Emotional disabled"" were confusing and don't really describe anything in particular. Would a person with an emotional illness, like Bipolar Disorder, be considered ""mentally unwell"" AND ""emotionally disabled?"" BPD is a disability under the DSM V, but I imagine may would ""self-identify"" as ""mentally unwell."" It just wasn't clear to me. Another offensive question was the one about suicide attempts. It came out of nowhere, and is likely triggering for a number of participants/potential participants. There was no warning in the consent form before the survey to talk about those issues, and no questions about a history of self-harm, or other examples of ways mental illness presents itself physically (e.g. eating disorders). Additionally on the long form page about family/friends/co-workers and whether sexual orientation is visible, two or three of the options were off the page and not even clickable. So I wanted to put N/A for some of them and simply could not. Your survey also seemed to teeter between focusing on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity as minorities, and Racial and/or Ethnic Identity. Those are two very large and complex areas of research on their own (as four, independent areas of research). I feel very strongly, as an academic myself completing research currently on Critical Race Theory, that you are not gaining anything of actual substance from the survey you've launched. Overall your language and imagery is questionable at best for a group of academics, and I'm disappointed. You may want to add some trigger warning(s) to the consent page. Also you may want to add to your consent page that this survey is not IRB Approved. If it were, you would have stated it.   Now to answer this actual question: As a multiracial, multiethnic, Cis-Hetero woman, I feel location plays an overt role in my relationships and my access to resources. The ability to be as educated as I am is a privilege, and places me in a socio-economic class that also directly impacts the same. Living in Connecticut, there is an abundance of wealth and a higher standard of living than where I grew up in the South. I feel much safer here than in some of the urban areas I've lived in the past, and I feel racism, sexism, and homophobia are far less common here in New England than they were in the South. That isn't to say it doesn't all exist, because it does. It is just much less blatant in the North East than it is in the South."

I'm also middle class and both my parents have an annual income of &gt;?œ100k so I have medical insurance and can access private therapy at any time and buy medication when I need it. The greatest support has always come from my academic departments (my sixth form high school, university) who accommodate for mental illness and go the extra mile to meet my needs. The NHS long waiting times did lead to a suicide attempt and the counselling provided did not help."

There are many emergency expresses near by and other services that are easily accessible. The towns police and departments are always out patrolling. The only time I felt unsafe was when my familys home had a fire a couple years ago and was displaced for months. This was because we had  to move and learn new ways of getting around and was sort of thrown outside of our comfort zone.

In addition, because my mom is a nurse and we live close to the city I have access to pretty good medical resources. I have not found any difficulty dealing with my gender and/or my identity, primarily because I don't belong to the LGBTQ+ organization, and society is more welcoming to individuals who are heterosexual or identify as a male or female compared to those who are lesbian or gay. In addition, because of that I believe that I am more comfortable going about society, whereas others may be ridiculed in his or her workspace, church, or home.
