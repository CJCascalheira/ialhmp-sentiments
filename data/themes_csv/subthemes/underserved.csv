My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything,  Since than im kind of really scared of people.  So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape  . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it.

My school and community was severely underserved. The community does not hold many of the important specialties, especially when concerning pediatric care. More so, mental health initiatives and counseling help is extremely limited in the area and can lead to challenges throughout the community.   For example, I was required to travel close to 200 miles round trip in order to receive treatment for a pediatric bleeding disorder as a child. The closest PICU is the same distance and has led to significant challenges for both my family and even more throughout the community. Emergency medicine is the highest risk in the area as transport can lead to poor health outcomes, particularly due tot he isolation associated with the community. The areas tobacco and drug problems are a extremely significant as well, as a result of previous tobacco  industry in the area, lack of resources to mental and physical health, poor education system, and low socioeconomic status.
