48,1.47%,"all_R_xzS9fYToU82qVy1 : So I live in a neighborhood that is constantly presumed as a dangerous place but in my option, bad things happen everywhere. It's been over a year since I was almost robbed by 3 kids around my age right in front of my own house, this was a month after moving from one part of my community to another.

The part that had me really concerned about my safety was that there were people nearby getting into a car who decided to pay no attention. After this, I walked on the opposite side of the street for months. Don't get me wrong growing up in this community was the absolute best even though we didn't enough money to do all the things kids had the opportunity to do we still made it fun. Growing up gay in a community predominately black people it was hard to come to terms with who I was because of a lot of negative stigma and bullying towards LGBTQ+ people.

Because I have such a wonderful relationship with my family, a strong connection with my friends, a great support group, and am neighbors to friends I grew up with together, the fact that we live in a neighborhood that isn't necessarily the safest and far from financially sound, doesn't faze me.

I am adequately provided with relationships. I feel safe and secure. I am also healthy. The Corona crisis is currently causing uncertainty, but hopefully that will pass in a few weeks.

My place of residence allows me to have many relationships and to be healthy. Mentally, because I can go to the sea or the forest, geographically, because I can see a doctor when I&amp;#39;m sick.

My personal development and diversity is limited by my place of residence because here you definitely stand out if you are something É ? ?differentÉ ? doesnÉ ? ? t matter whether you are figure, character, etc. Because I have complexities with my figure despite having a normal build I feel the pressure here in Coburg is significantly greater than in larger cities.

Due to the Covid-19 situation, I moved the 400km back to my home, as I have several foster care cases and high-risk patients in the family who my brother and I support. This also means that the visit from my life partner is no longer necessary. The distance puts a strain on the relationship, but I will move away from emden and after our studies are over we will see. I feel safe in all three places. I don&amp;#39;t regret the decision to change my place of residence due to my studies. Emden is a very pleasant city. It&amp;#39;s big enough but not a big city.

I very much wish that I had a steady center of life. Otherwise the place of residence is perfectly fine and no worse or better than anywhere else.

It's not something I've given much thought. I have a doctor, and my family is always there to help me if I ever need it, I've never really felt like I had a reason to worry about anything. I've always been able to keep a smile on my face, well, most of the time anyway, and that's what I think is important.

I live in the Deep South, and frequently feel like I am not in a community that supports my identity and choices. ItÉ??s hard to maintain my core values and beliefs when it feels like IÉ??m surrounded by opposing views. I am also *slowly* pursuing a career path in sexuality education, and there are almost no in-person resources (workshops, seminars, classes, etc) geographically near me. But as a single parent, with deep family roots and support from my parents, I feel that I really have no choice but to stay here.

My life would be miserable without them because my family doesn't understand. I'm going to admit here that I'm starting to consider myself Agender but I don't know if I'd ever admit that to my family because my asexuality already makes me a joke.

I own this 103 year old house and have dogs, cats and even chickens. And a garden. There are lots of things to do that don't cost much -- basically, this is a good area in which to age in place, supporting myself emotionally and financially, trying not to be a bother, just going along and getting along. My family and I are comfortable, there are things that we just don't talk about, but, overall, I feel loved and respected. It's good"

My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything, Since than im kind of really scared of people. So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it.

My biggest set back in my happiness, in my development as a woman is the fact that the mother of my children currently lives with us even though we are no longer together. It has created a hostile home life. Yet I do have a really good support network other than that. The lack of trans related healthcare through my workplace is the only other cause of stress in my life. Overall I am lucky."

26 - 27,0.31%,"all_R_2ds8I75fCO2eiWc : In some ways I am very, very lucky. I have a loving husband, a house, and many lovely animals. Where I live is on the surface very accepting. However, we have one of the most famous TERFs in the US living here and she's found a lot of support. Also, Black trans women keep dying."
28,0.50%,"all_R_1q2HxJzXLvrrRid : Worth pointing out that I am currently in the middle of Shelter in Place protocol for the COVID19 pandemic, which has affected people's availability. Geographically, the DFW metro is very spread-out, which tends to make it hard for people to see each other on a regular basis under the best of circumstances. Also, socially, this area has lots of history in Evangelical Christianity, which tends to skew acceptance of alternative sexualities or gender identities."
29 - 30,0.29%,"all_R_11dQ5TdHDuSgVUl : I have little access in my area to physical health care providers who I feel are trans competent. I have a network of caring, supportive people in my community.

31,0.72%,"all_R_3qJpXiYh2KaKGKo : I used to live in the American South (NC &amp; VA), and was deeply impoverished. Even with a welcoming, close friendship group, life was very hard. I have since moved to rural northern Illinois. While it's not perfect, my life is much better for having the political support of a blue state. Things like unions, easier employment, and more money overall have directly helped my safety and security. I also experience a lot more places of business and state agencies that have sexuality and gender identity as protected classes written into their foundational documents, and it shows. Even with something as simple as getting a haircut (present pandemic excluded) is so much better now."

My location has sometimes led me to feel unsafe over the past several years in a different, extremely specific wayÉ??in my apartment I can often hear my downstairs neighbor, and he is routinely aggressive.

A lot of my friends do not have the things I am blessed with and I have seen their struggles and it pains me."

38 - 39,0.41%,"all_R_27BiIY0fNbtfLK6 : Where I live is terrible for transgendered people. I live in small town east texas and I'm constantly worried or fearing for myself. My spouse is very supportive of me as she has been here before the transition. My family is very welcoming and okay with it. But strangers here, not so much.

I left home 18 months ago and moved to WÅrzburg. As a young person I feel freer and more comfortable because of the many offers. I&amp;#39;ve often felt cramped in the country.

PNV (outside world), quickly in parks or forests or at the lake for relaxation. A healthy lifestyle is absolutely possible in my current life situation.

62,0.73%,"all_R_TtEWc34Wzb2q4ff : I live very rural with my parents in a big house. It takes us over half an hour to get to the nearest hospital. When my mother was sick recently, I first became aware of this distance. If we want to go out in the evening, to the cinema or to an indoor swimming pool, we drive almost an hour. The motorway (no matter in which direction) is min. half an hour away. For young people, of course, that&amp;#39;s often annoying. In return, we have the same distance to all larger cities (eg Kaiserslautern). All in all, I feel very comfortable here and couldn&amp;#39;t imagine living in a small apartment in the city for long. So when I finish my studies, I definitely want to stay around here somewhere."
