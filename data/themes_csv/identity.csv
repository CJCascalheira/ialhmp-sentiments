1,0.51%,all_R_3gOE7Fnzuayslcg : I am about to move to rural Alaska for a new attorney position with the Public Defender Agency. I'm really excited about the job and starting a new professional life. But I am very nervous about opportunities for living openly and actively gay in a small town 400 miles from the road system. My responses are likely to change from the ones made now while living in Northern California.
2,0.14%,all_R_21bm8kIE9ZD3bc6 : Conservative state makes me fearful of the reaction from strangers learning I'm gay
3,0.07%,My location is a middle class area with easy connections
4,0.40%,"all_R_24GHrSkTv1hj6yl : My city is pretty liberal, especially considering it's in a conservative state. I don't feel safe being out as trans but I also prefer being stealth for other reasons. I had some trouble finding a therapist that wasn't faith-based but there are a few doctors in my area that specialize in trans care."
05-Jul,0.70%,"all_R_2VDyn1a4IXjaZ8h : I live in what is known as the ""Bible belt"". While I'm open to who people are I can say I have rarely experienced the same. My mother knows I'm bi and pretends I'm not to the point of being openly homophobic around me. My husband had a hard time with accepting me when I came out and my kids still don't know. I know for a fact after watching how my extended family and church reacted when my aunt came out that I would be disowned, shunned, and I would have to fear my immediate family as well as my in-laws trying to take my kids away."
8,0.52%,"all_R_3k5JOJoboDVAcia : I live right between, nearly on the border of, two very different cities. The capital city is more pleasant and more accepting, whereas the one west of me is a lot more conservative and it's terrifying. I don't always pass, and I've definitely had a lot of older people from that town closely inspect my face. Luckily I have grown some facial hair at this point. It's very anxiety inducing."
9,0.46%,all_R_9vjNJRzxXN7AdAl : The region is in part gilded in that it wants others to think it is great but then internally clings to discrimination. Other areas just outright embrace their bigotry which is easier to deal with (while the former has a gaslit feel). Things have also gotten exponentially worse since the 2016 election and I am worried for the future as a result.
10,0.63%,"all_R_zfd1ZUGPLx1bCoN : I believe that since I come from a working-class community that most of the people around me have similar issues. I feel safe in my current location because I am familiar with my community members. I do think that since a lot of people in my location are immigrants, that it may be difficult to be gay. Since a lot of these individuals come from countries where not being heterosexual is a sin, or a crime. In regards to that, I can see how someone may feel unsafe or uncomfortable."
11-Dec,0.92%,"all_R_3KGwl1gjeOIiOqq : I live in a very conservative town, and having a girlfriend of a different race (not caucasian) would most definitely impact my life. My health nor safety would be impacted, but people would definitely question why I chose a girl of colour as my partner. Growing up mixed (half German and half Japanese) impacted my mental health as a kid, as kids would bully me for my differences. So unfortunately, I would expect some sort of backlash from the community that I live in if I dated a girl of different ethnic background. Thankfully, my town is growing more open, and I can definitely see a change in the near future, but as of right now I feel like there is still racism and prejudice amongst the people of my town."
13,0.45%,"all_R_1IdeVMGFrH5cVxG : My hometown is very safe when it comes to physical health. It's a small town; therefore, there are not many places to go for mental health help. Especially for minorities. For a teenager, who is a person of colour, everything feels predominantly white. The ostracizing doesn't come from peers but mostly adults (specifically teachers)."
14 - 16,1.28%,"all_R_21jlpjStavIpmFQ : Relatively speaking I live in a good location, in a good house. We are good in money and such. We are close to a pharmacy and have access to other health resources. Being that I am heterosexual and cisgender I don't experience any discrimination in that regard. While I am an immigrant I came here as a baby so it does not affect me too much if I were not able to talk English or have had an accent. The only experience I had where this was an issue was when I was younger where I would be teased for being Chinese and Korean at school and with strangers where kids would point out I'm Chinese. In more recent events I was insulted at a bus stop because I would not give a man money so he called me fucking immigrant. That being said my relative relationships with people are not too affected due to my sexual orientation or sexual identity. Where I am located, mental health is widely embraced and is rarely ridiculed. And probably the biggest issue I face is being Filipino, but even then it is not too bad."
17,0.20%,"all_R_3MQYsljE6efyxOV : As an immigrant, I sometimes feel there is no help by things around me but living with my family keeps me being healthy and stable."
18,0.16%,"all_R_2CTJEXbT4SBVda5 : My location has greatly impacted my well being in a good way, my location made me feel safe and accepted."
19,0.19%,all_R_3eh1blL2Eamqzio : My location is a very multi cultural and accepting neighbourhood. It is also safe and I have never had to fear being myself here.
20 - 21,0.56%,"all_R_1ltphs8Yqe84p45 : I'm certainly grateful for being able to live with my sexual orientation being out and accepted. I feel like I don't have the same opportunities as other people in my society because support for my physical and mental disabilities is so meager. I feel like I'm missing out on life. Generally I feel safe, even if the police refused to take any action against my neighbour who threatened to kill me due to my sexual orientation."
22,0.59%,"all_R_2ZKZpUSuL7rxvQ6 : I am a straight African American woman, I feel as though sometimes I am looked at with a suspicious light because some people assume I am going to do something devious due to my race. It's the little things like clutching on to their purses as they walk past me or putting a bag down on the seat in the bus. Although these microaggressions are not something I face every single day, they happen enough for me to notice them and feel sad about them."
23,0.44%,"all_R_1K6V93VHOiR2zf9 : The only thing I am currently aware of, is that my geographic location controls who I may encounter daily. But ultimately, I know what is meant to be in my life will. The same goes for my identities. I tend to exist at the intersection of many groups of people. With that awareness, whoever is meant to co-exist with me, will."
24,0.24%,"all_R_2YFaNeQCVyiclSw : In Rowlett Tx, I feel mostly safe! I wouldn't feel comfortable here going out openly in public with a partner though. But I am not comfortable with PDA in general."
25,0.45%,all_R_9tdshc9KzQricVj : 1. Unable or inconvenient to always meet-up with significant other (living in different towns) 2. Feel at ease and welcomed when walking around neighbourhood; feel relatively safe but still vigilant when walking alone at night 3. Tend to not share my location with others of different ethnicity that aren't my own due to fear of racism
26,0.70%,"all_R_XKYWhSSngDmF3Md : Currently, my location is keeping me safe, as a response to COVID. I am supported in most of my lifestyle choices by the laws that are in place. and i feel safe in my sexual orientation. I feel the minimum wage in my country is fair, and I have been supported by jobs in the past, enough to stay afloat, as well as have some spending money. I am overall very content with Canada, I think it is a beautiful country, and I believe it helps many cultures feel appreciated and heard. I am also able to get adequate care for my mental health."
27,0.51%,"all_R_RfQrnFLsVhm9yff : It does not have a great impact on my life at the moment, however I remain anxious about my future. There are many hardships that come with being who I am, and as of right now, I am unsure of whether I am ready or not to face them. I have a great support system that allows me to feel comfortable in my own skin, and so I feel at ease when it comes to facing obstacles as of right now."
28,1.03%,"all_R_1hB8H9XKvxuc48M : Scarborough is known in Toronto for being one of the less secure areas, however, personally, I find Sherbourne to be the Mordor of Toronto(I.E It freaks me out to go there). I don't think the air in Toronto is particularly clean. All these industrial factories are polluting the air. Relationships in Toronto are the worst. You have to be a 7/10 or higher to find a relationship without unbearable difficulty. However, Toronto still is the best environment for me considering financial supports, health supports, and overall social help. The only place I would rather live in is England. As for my identity, I'm largely a product of colonialism as arguably most people are today. Honestly, I think I have identity issues and sometimes can decide what I identify as(depending on the sort of identity."
29,0.25%,"all_R_0p3StykfZxJYzKN : Due to living in Toronto, I am pretty comfortable in my shoes. Most of the time I love all of my identities and since I live in Canada I'm pretty safe with my sexual identity."
30,0.41%,"all_R_25EY9f4LHf6RVIv : I live in a very decent location. I have lived in the same house since I was a year old, and it has always been enjoyable and safe. No crimes or violence have occurred in the area. Even as a small, black woman I don't have much fear walking my dog at night (though I remain very aware of my surroundings)."
31,0.32%,all_R_pbZK4rVoOmtevfP : My geographic location has been very close to home for my family and I. There has never been discrimination against my ethnicity up until recently. the neighbourhood is generally pretty safe with a bit of robbery here and there.
32,0.56%,"all_R_1QEDph3FTMpQj8S : Since I live in Canada, specifically Ontario, I am not as severely impacted by the COVID-19 situation. But regardless, I am still worried by constantly seeing the number of cases increase. There is definitely some blatant racism towards members of Asian and more significantly the Chinese community. I feel somewhat safe because the prime minister has given those without jobs a place to receive money through EI benefits."
33 - 35,1.47%,"all_R_xzS9fYToU82qVy1 : So I live in a neighborhood that is constantly presumed as a dangerous place but in my option, bad things happen everywhere. It's been over a year since I was almost robbed by 3 kids around my age right in front of my own house, this was a month after moving from one part of my community to another. This made me feel really unsafe because I could have died that day but I managed to get away even though these people had a knife pointed at me. The part that had me really concerned about my safety was that there were people nearby getting into a car who decided to pay no attention. After this, I walked on the opposite side of the street for months. Don't get me wrong growing up in this community was the absolute best even though we didn't enough money to do all the things kids had the opportunity to do we still made it fun. Growing up gay in a community predominately black people it was hard to come to terms with who I was because of a lot of negative stigma and bullying towards LGBTQ+ people. But as a child, I'd always look forward to the community barbeques because that's when the best of people would come out, everyone was treated like family."
36,0.22%,"all_R_2tD1QPHxWx2KcdU : I feel that living in the northeast people are more accepting and open minded about a lot of ideas, and feel very accepted for my sexuality and respected."
37,0.22%,all_R_6hBRyaRD9YjAWWJ : If born in a safe place (without war) or a place without stereotype then my life will be safer and i will be more healthy and have good relationship.
38,0.19%,all_R_2c5gmvjon59QhZ4 : I feel that living in a larger city has helped my situation a lot. I moved from a rural area that was not very lgbt+ friendly.
39,0.20%,all_R_32PaiPRj81tXS9Q : The town I grew up in restricted my ability to express myself and my gender and sexual identities as freely as I might have wished.
40,0.24%,"all_R_2067esG2pYu3xux : My location is alright, I live in a mainly Hispanic community and there are small pockets of other cultures. My safety is okay and my health too. Relationships are good."
41 - 43,0.80%,"all_R_2RPsurlEtgCe4HO : I felt that because of the neighborhood I grew up in and the kind of people around me I was never able to really be myself. Hanging out with friends of a different gender got me slut-shamed by my parents and our church in middle school and that's stuck with me ever since. Because I grew up in a very conservative, religious neighborhood I had to deal with people talking trash about people of different gender identities, sexual orientations, and races. It painted a very grim picture of the world to me. It also didn't help that not only did my parents not believe in mental illnesses but also couldn't afford therapy."
44,0.56%,"all_R_ZrWxAh3N1e6nMkN : I am in the middle of nowhere and all my friends already went home. So I'm super depressed since I know no one from Merced and nothing to do. If I was back in my home town Mountain View then I would not be having these feelings. Also, people are less open minded here so I'm not always comfortable holding my girlfriends hand in public or giving her any form of affection. I've received dirty looks when I have in the past."
45 - 46,0.33%,all_R_3FLILGH552IS5Lo : Although I am surrounded most of the time with people who support me I feel as though when I reveal that I am bisexual that support will be taken away from me and is something I will not be able to gain again once they know the truth about me.
47,0.50%,"all_R_2CIKifAoVDFxCxZ : Being at home has impacted me a lot because my family expects me to be a certain person that I don't have to be when i'm away, its hard to show your change when they have such a strong idea of who they think you are.. I am more confined and have a lot of responsibilities that can overwhelm me when I have to balance with school. I'm further away from the people I trust most."
48,0.35%,"all_R_3j8Lk9rTpWvGCfU : As someone who did not use to live in the US, I definitely think my geographic location has allowed me to feel more safe, and the open culture has allowed me to feel more comfortable with my self, and to do more than I would've done if I did not live here."
49,0.75%,"all_R_ZCWuZOWFA9G8t9f : My geographic location can be considered a safe small town, predominantly latino which makes it feel as a community. There is access to health facilities which makes it easy for people to seek medical attention if needed. The only downside would be that because it is a small town, relationships matter in the way that there are 3 or 4 high schools and most people know or have heard of each other so there's this implied ""reputation"" to uphold because things spread easily. This can be harmful in the way that if there are bad rumors being spread this can cause bullying or shaming."
50,1.71%,"all_R_1okdcrBLv1cw5Vy : I live with my immigrant parents (both residents) and my 3 siblings in a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom duplex in a really nice neighborhood (its right next to google- keeps getting more and more gentrified). We are low income, have always been, my mom is a taco bell cook and my dad is a gardener (have always been since they got to California from Mexico which is about 20 years) but because of where we live minimum wage is good and we are in the silicon valley with really nice big houses around so my dad gets paid okay so we are not poor at least it doesn't feel like we are so much because we do a good job of blending in but our AC and our heater don't work, parents still struggle with paying rent every month but somehow manage- me and my older brother used to work before quarantine, my little brothers still get reduced lunch and free bus passes, and I've managed to get really good scholarships from the high school I went to because it was a really rich predominantly white high school and there were very good chances of winning these scholarships especially because of im a minority and low income who wanted to go to college. In some of my answers, I reported feeling sad and depressed might have something to do with quarantine but if I recall correctly I still felt that way before just not as often probably because there were more distractions."
51,0.13%,all_R_yjCWkmvAKeKJhsJ : My location impacts my ability to come out to people and by my true self.
52,0.25%,all_R_Y3lPxuZB4tDH3Xz : My location is known for housing very racist and/or heavily conservative people. This causes me to have little access to acceptable mental health services/ police protection/ etc
1,0.08%,zero_R_r2bjCCAWqM7YccV : I have a good family upbringing.
2,0.18%,"zero_R_2BkUUZBpGv7ndSa : I think growing up where I did sheltered me a bit, but living so close to Champaign it was very diverse."
3,0.28%,zero_R_2YlXYAK20q2D5WJ : being at school away from home it helps me to find who I am as a person. I am finally on my own which allows me to be who I am and find my path without anyone interfering.
4,0.18%,zero_R_12KgyyEb3Kr4vlh : I'm very happy with were I've grown up and how my family has raised me up to this point of my life.
5,0.29%,zero_R_1Ksi2EGTmLkx90L : I feel that the location I grew up in has helped me in overcoming my issues because I do not come from a wealthy city or town but a place that has to work for what they want to achieve.
6,0.22%,zero_R_2qyhl1XOCulA02d : I was fortunate enough to grow up somewhere where I di not have to worry aboutt much but gaining an education and creating relations.
07-Aug,0.77%,"zero_R_3Mz0cDPMpYXDnwl : My place of residence influences me in the way that I can be free, geographically but also as a person. I can go anywhere without limits, I can develop freely, I can enjoy nature. I can ride my bike alone at three o&amp;#39;clock in the morning without fear. My place of residence allows me to have many relationships and to be healthy. Mentally, because I can go to the sea or the forest, geographically, because I can see a doctor when I&amp;#39;m sick. My place of residence is part of my identity and often makes me feel good."
9,0.52%,"zero_R_3KwNIU6DYlIvZwl : My place of residence is freedom for me (I lived very remote as a child). Close to the city center, access to all shops for daily needs, everything is within walking distance. I meet friends more often and go partying more often because it is no longer difficult (how do I get home?). However, I used to be sick less often in the country than I am now."
10,0.67%,"zero_R_2ctHkomWPrsiwtp : My place of residence is still relatively new to me (moved in 6 months ago). There was something liberating, if at times frightening, about moving out of my parents&amp;#39; house. All in all, it wasn&amp;#39;t difficult for me to leave my hometown. In Leipzig I feel very well and at home now. I live in a shared apartment with 3 flatmates, it took me a while to get used to, but now I get on very well with them and I&amp;#39;m happy to see them again."
11,0.32%,"all_R_2PBWkL2ebpWp4GE : Carbondale is my current home but I am originally from Chicago. The culture here is much more conserved than Chicago's, which is taking some major adaptations to my mental health and the way I move daily."
12,0.29%,"all_R_3hrQrVYqbpvibK8 : I think college is stressing me out, but making me stronger at the same time. I am forced to be more independent, self-aware, and having to work 10 times harder than I did before."
13,0.13%,all_R_TqswRDm627ptGed : My location impacts me because it helped me become who I am today.
14,0.13%,all_R_3LiJ2a6EAglNh85 : The environment I grew up in shaped me into the person I am today.
15 - 17,0.20%,"all_R_3hzt3PzIJtINitl : Living in a rural area, I feel it is less acceptable to be openly queer. I am safe but I bet some people are not."
18,0.25%,all_R_3pfJdrNmvdAOKzV : I feel as though my location and relationships that I have with people around me is most definitely a positive contribution to the man that I am today.
19,0.56%,"all_R_3HYplMgEZX1X11P : My location impacts my friendships and romantic relationships, as they are frequently long-distance. My location and the locations I have lived at in the past influence my identity as well; I frequently moved cross-country or to other countries growing up which solidified my ethnic identity as I felt disconnected from any ancestry or place more narrow than the United States"
20,0.59%,"all_R_3FLrUR63dyidKE6 : Where I live there is no help for undocumented immigrants. For that reason, my family and I think hard before going to the doctor. In fact, we almost never due, unless it is an absolute emergency. This really has a big effect in my health. I have had jaw pain for the past couple of months and although my parents have tried to convince me to get seen by a doctor, I know that we can not afford it."
21,0.31%,"all_R_Dv4xNkvb1kYhIxX : I think the fact that I grew up mainly in a black home, black parents in general tend to care less about their children's emotions. They feel as though because I'm a boy, emotions are not a thing."
22,0.42%,all_R_1pEFKSqgUhFo2Ys : My location has a big impact on who I am and who I have become. It is a safe place for me to live and a place I like to live. It has been good to me and provided a place of comfort and safety. I have met some great people and friends that I will keep with me my whole life.
23,0.19%,"all_R_vvIAxm5C0cpYuvT : Impacts me in a lot of ways. Being around my friends, coaches and teammates helps me become who I am suppose to be"
24 - 27,1.24%,"all_R_DcwAYA2SpjwiCTD : I live in a pretty safe suburban neighborhood so I guess that would explain why I very rarely felt unsafe in my life. In addition, because my mom is a nurse and we live close to the city I have access to pretty good medical resources. I have not found any difficulty dealing with my gender and/or my identity, primarily because I don't belong to the LGBTQ+ organization, and society is more welcoming to individuals who are heterosexual or identify as a male or female compared to those who are lesbian or gay. In addition, because of that I believe that I am more comfortable going about society, whereas others may be ridiculed in his or her workspace, church, or home. As for my ethnicity, because I am Asian, I have faced some difficulty and racist comments when growing up, but it did not really bother me or stunt my confidence or my appreciation for my culture."
28,0.40%,"all_R_2eRUQppK7U6VDMP : I am always traveling or hanging out at various places so I never feel as if my location impacts me too much. Sometimes, however, if I'm in an environment that makes me feel inferior, I try to better myself to the standards of that area, making myself superior."
29,0.22%,"all_R_1d186U8zXt5VjGe : I live in a safe and accepting place, and I am in a place of privilege so I don't usually fear not being safe except for being a woman"
30,0.43%,"all_R_3lFDqOZloKFHlFO : I am a straight cisgender woman and living in Brooklyn does not impact my identity, in regards to not being accepted, because being straight is considered a ""norm."" I do travel late on the train at night so sometimes I feel like my life might be in danger from male sexual predators."
31,0.28%,all_R_3EbA0M6XRbxbuTM : Living in a nice neighborhood exposed me to the more beautiful aspects of childhood and humanity. I believe my upbringing has made me into the best person I could have been.
32,0.46%,all_R_27JzkeYZLZHZCQD : I have overall lived an exteremely blessed life. My environment allowed me to make freinds and get a good education that many others havent gotten the opportunity to experience. My parents are loving and have always pushed me educationally and to try new things. Ive overall felt safe in my environment.

1,0.68%,"all_R_xuBkHekC49B0sMx : I live in South central Ky. We are in the Bible Belt. My husband is black, and we are both overweight. It is sometimes hard to overcome such stringent discrimination, as most people here have a 1950 mindset. The hateful stares and eye rolling is sometimes hard to deal with. I am more offended than my husband is by these actions. He says that he is just accustomed to this treatment, and he does not let it bother him. I have so many thoughts as to why that is wrong in about 10 ways. No person should have to get used to such abhorrent treatment. Racism, sexism, and classism are still prevalent in the South."

4,0.45%,"all_R_2rjali6znLKa9IA : I live in a very racially divided area that isn't very accepting despite being fairly liberal. Since coming out I've experienced much more discrimination than I expected I would, and this has had significant impacts on my mental health and, at times, safety. I do know that I am somewhat lucky to live where I do because accessing support resources is relatively easy, especially given my stable financial situation."

Oct-13,0.33%,"all_R_4VCnUJWfx2bmMtH : I live in one of the most conservative counties in Colorado (US).

Lots of racism and xenophobia toward our high immigrant/refugee population."

15,0.48%,"all_R_3qxuxyMrygNzDSU : My location impacts me because I had no choice in living under the laws that benefit most others but repress me or my rights, and thus my opportunities regardless of qualifications--I get to see discrimination because of living through it, having no choice when it happens to me other than having my own voice. My location impacts me by my awareness of my surroundings, from class, to race, to age, to social connection, to accessibility of idea."
16,0.27%,"all_R_25SDnnbl0Kzdkun : Living in the middle of nowhere is weird, even though its a college town. All of my friends are queer, but none of us are from here, and people that are from here look down on us a lot. I do not feel safe or welcome in my community at large."
17,0.66%,"all_R_3EMbHtkTEM4a6ol : I was raised in the LDS Church but my parents allowed me to choose whether to attend services. I stopped attending at age 15 and formally withdrew my record of membership at age 23. The state-level government is majority LDS and this impacts many laws. LDS membership is not as popular in the Salt Lake City area, so I feel more comfortable near Salt Lake than in other areas of the state. I am in a straight passing relationship and only came to terms with my bisexuality a few years ago, so I have not experienced any significant discrimination first hand, but my heart hurts for other LGBTQ folks in Utah, especially young adults."
18 - 19,0.28%,all_R_25L1pYtsfxZiMC4 : My geographical location is both negative and extremely harmful to my emotional and mental wellbeing. The hate crimes and mindset against LGBTQIA+ individuals is a constant in my life. I am stressed and and depressed nearly constantly when out of my home
20,0.48%,"all_R_DHJEb9pE4FWnxO9 : I feel that thereƒ??s a lack of knowledge about LGBT+ community issues where I live. Gender and sexuality are rarely acknowledged by people Iƒ??m not close friends with already, and Iƒ??ve faced a good deal of harassment and discrimination, mostly at work, because of my gender here. Despite its reputation as an open, progressive city, I feel that a lot of discrimination happens out in the open here and nobody notices enough to do anything about it."
21 - 22,0.86%,"all_R_20ZsRh8jYlOgPTx : I live in a very conservative area which can make it difficult to find places where I will be accepted. I had to leave a church because of that, found a new one after a few years and a lot of grief, I currently work at a progressive place that in theory accepts trans people but Iƒ??ve encountered an amount of transphobia from coworkers. I want to find another place to work but Iƒ??m just so worried about how they will deal with me being trans. Passing isnƒ??t a thing for non-binary people so going stealth isnƒ??t an option. If I ever want to be accepted for who I am I have to out myself. My parents love me but I know they donƒ??t think what Iƒ??m doing is right. Theyƒ??re conservative Christians. Iƒ??m thankful we have the relationship we do but it makes me sad that they donƒ??t understand or accept me for who I am."
23,0.28%,"all_R_2dNpDs2EV5xhlts : I dont live in a place with easy or affordable access to LGBTQ healthcare or anything, so I havent been able to start medical transition yet or anything. I'm not out in a lot of places because of that because I worry about not passing and being unsafe"
24 - 25,0.39%,"all_R_yR3lQFWCsc2F6Nz : I feel like I live in a fairly liberal and safe area. Sometimes I do get nervous ƒ??showing offƒ?? being queer, neurodiverse, atheist but mostly feel okay being myself. There are some things I definitely do not feel safe or comfortable doing/wearing outside of the house for safety reasons (certain queer clothes, acting autistic in front of cops/authority figures)"
26,0.26%,all_R_1gwHHSOfAO9G9cz : I think that living in the bay area is one of the more open and accepting places to be. I find that my sexual orientation of asexuality is largely misunderstood and not taken seriously. I don't believe this is related to my location.
27 - 29,0.40%,"all_R_3JtlJ56l3uclR3l : Portland, Oregon is a very liberal town, and has pockets and islands which are definitely havens for folk in the LGBTQ+ community. That said, there are still bigots, rainbow flags get stolen and vandalized, Proud Boys come to town and dogpile folk that don't fit their idea of 'Murican, and queer acceptance is not universal. Nothing is perfect, but Portland is trying."
30 - 32,0.38%,all_R_2S7gCCumj5zQOF7 : Living in Missouri limits my access to healthcare (because they refuse to expand medicare - we had health insurance through my wife's work but she is now unemployed). It also is a detriment to my mental health in that the surrounding community is largely hostile toward queer people and our lawmakers make frequent attempts to limit our legal rights.
33,0.82%,"all_R_3iVG9N6MYTSEBib : The high degree of conformaty present in Utah also manages to create an environment in which counterculture groups provide meaningful touchstones for non-conforming persons. I have found that the SM community is quite dedicated and valued amongst its members. I have been largely isolated from the BDSM community in the months of Covid-19 precaution and that absence has negatively impacted my health and self worth. The prevailing religion is also a cultural force. When I worked for a Mormon organization, my outgroup status made me feel extremely devalued. It's hard to avoid that feeling in this state. I have a lot to say about how unsafe I feel in this state, how my childhood was fraught with rejection and sadness and how those thoughts persist. Thank you for doing this research."
34,0.14%,"all_R_1opVqtXQyZ4dgxI : I live in a conservative part of the country, which makes it really hard to just be myself and be openly transgender."
35,0.41%,"all_R_2t36qEYTXr0izeZ : Living in Texas, even in San Antonio, isn't safe for the trans community. Last week, a transwoman was stabbed to death because ""god sent this guy"" to kill her. I live 5,000 miles away from my husband, one of my biggest sources of social support. I have some support here, but living away from my husband has a massive negative impact on my emotional well-being and overall stability."
36 - 37,0.39%,"all_R_1SlZMhMWxgEwGFr : Living in north Texas with no transportation is a close to impossible scenario for anyone existing on the spectrum. These communities are often very conservative, heavily invested in institutionalized racism and discrimination, with zero infrastructure in place to help those identifying with normative paradigm. Living here is a nightmare for someone like me."
38,0.73%,"all_R_1LB5LpZ13lBga46 : Phoenix is family orientated with a strong republican foundation for values. They do not have a large LGBT population and make active strides to limit LGBT events &amp; functions. As a working professional, Phoenix provides great job growth and competitive salaries. With that being said, Phoenix does not provide a sense of community and makes it nearly impossible to meet other LGBT individuals. As a young adult (22), I am actively seeking to relocate in hopes of meeting other like-minded individuals &amp; to be become apart of a community. Phoenix isnƒ??t the worst when it comes to LGBT representation, but it does create a sense of loneliness due to the lack of community and resources."
39 - 41,0.40%,"all_R_2dTlczEjzzIDL1Q : Very few folks around here are anything but white, christian, and straight. Being a queer transwoman who semi-follows a non-abrahamic faith I don't fit in, at all. 95% of the time this is fine, the other 5% is where you get some bigotry shining out. I've never been physically attacked in this area, but I've certainly been treated as less than human due to being trans."
42,0.29%,"all_R_2ysJOVVmtkjEyTB : Santa Fe is better for transgender people than where I used to live, Flagstaff, Arizona, but still presents problems with transphobic people. I identify as non-binary, transgender and genderqueer. You did not allow multiple options. My wife is a transgender woman."
43 - 44,1.91%,"all_R_2eXBZZiMB0KLL6F : Im an FTM transgender who live in the less open minded side of israel. I rarely go out of home and stuck with no job for 2 years now. My mother is my emotional support and is the sole reason i havent killed myself yet. I do have a circle of friends who are like a family to me but they live far away(in the tlv region which is 3 hours away on publoc transport.) My health is bad because i have mental issues and born physical issues (i am facing with weak immune system severe allergies to common things and I have endometryosis, which is basically my female reproductive internal organ slowly killing me, at least thats how it feels), whenever i end up in ER *sometimes* doctors refuse to take me in because of my transgenderism. So whenever im ill i prefer not to face any unfamiliar doctors. Tbh i used to work in sales and was assulted, and even though i filed a charge no one did anything, Since than im kind of really scared of people. So even though israel is really accepting the gay/lesbian theres still a long way with transgenders that no one talks about. Since i mpved back with my parents to my old hometown after the assult no one hires me (worked in tlv previously), and lately i feel hopless when it comes to standing on my own. I have my friends and i have a band which i hold onto dearly. But thats it. I cant see myself getting a proper job bec ill always have to face strangrs. And im terrified. Its been 2 years and i cant face my fears yet.israel claim to be the 'wokest' country in the middle east but thats a huge bluff. The gov is fine but the people themself. Theres still the harsh middle eastern brutal mentality, that you cant escape . I often think that there might be a good place for people like me, i often dream of canada, but i know, thats just it. A dream. Im sure thats also illusion. And that theres no really safe space anywhere ."
45 - 47,0.37%,"all_R_3JxvrQO5Nac2T0T : I live in a very Mormon region, and come from a very Mormon family and heritage. Mormonism does not recognize trans peopleƒ??s identities and they openly pathologies non-heterosexuality. That deeply impacts the perspectives of my local community, family, local laws, and my access to adequate medical care, especially mental health care."
48 - 49,0.31%,"all_R_R4gI8pkbK0QkiTT : I live in Arkansas. Which has come a long way in dealing with the LGBTQ. But I still feel like I canƒ??t come fully out of the closet. Luckily, my husband is very supportive of me. I feel like because Iƒ??m married if I were to come out of the closet as Bi nobody would believe me."
50,0.45%,"all_R_2XoFE3rQ8iLZYJ0 : I am a Latina living with my White girlfriend in West Oakland, which is heavily gentrified. We have monetary support from family until Covid ends then we have to find jobs. My girlfriend has PTSD from a bullet entering her house when she was there and there are often gunshots (less now after covid). Ableism in the world (disguised as a ""work ethic"" value) in the context of capitalism is the main thing keeping me down."
51,0.23%,"all_R_2tnVljaGGNF2JOV : In Austin Texas, my LGBT status is less of a problem than it would be for me in other cities, but I still stand out and occasionally am discriminated against. I am misgendered frequently, and intentionally."
52,0.58%,"all_R_RCcsehleciteGM9 : I donƒ??t really know many other queer people here. There was an openly trans guy in one of my classes and a trans woman in another, both whoƒ??d already started there transition. As someone who hasnƒ??t started anything and might end up being non-binary, I didnƒ??t really feel like I could talk to them about being gender queer because I donƒ??t know they might be transmed or enby-phobic. Besides that, everyone else kinda seems to live in a queer free world, and you canƒ??t tell whoƒ??s queer-phobic, awkward around queer people, or an ally"
53,0.24%,"all_R_RKW4ZqpO4wPxlRv : I am very lucky to be where I am. I have good access to reliable trans-oriented healthcare that is covered by my insurance. I am outwardly trans and though my area is accepting, I still do and have faced bigotry."
54 - 55,0.31%,"all_R_2ds8I75fCO2eiWc : In some ways I am very, very lucky. I have a loving husband, a house, and many lovely animals. Where I live is on the surface very accepting. However, we have one of the most famous TERFs in the US living here and she's found a lot of support. Also, Black trans women keep dying."
56 - 57,0.57%,all_R_25FsXA8W6Wym7QW : I live in a mostly republican neighborhood. most times people try to respect my pronouns and identity but I've had people tell me straight to my face they could never call me a man because I dont look like one. I also have been shoulder checked for walking around the town fair and looking the way I do. For the most part I feel safe in my own home but my partner worries about me having pride stickers on my car or on display on our porch. Recently though things have gotten easier because the facemasks hide my more effeminate features.
58 - 59,0.28%,all_R_3HCfhCK3O51Y3WM : Living in Texas can be a little hard. I am visibly Transfeminine and I work in an cleanroom where I am unable to wear makeup or a wig or a dress ect. so being so early in my transition can be a little rough with the way ppl tend to treat me here.
60 - 61,0.79%,"all_R_WpMku8nCdcdNpct : I have spent my life hiding most of my disability from others and being emotionally neglected when I did express a need for accommodation. I didnƒ??t have my Autism diagnosis until I was an adult which made me more susceptible to harassment. My peers physically assaulted me for being different more times than I count. My first memory of expressing my gender was met with assault by a classmate, I was 8. It is normalized to bully in this area, a part of the social norms. When I came out about my identity in high school, I had major backlash including being abandoned by my entire support system. The area where I live makes me fear living as my genuine self. My disability stops me from leaving. I need care and support and canƒ??t hold a job. I feel stuck."
62 - 64,0.34%,"all_R_2tFNj549GhYW1dg : This area is a desert for quality jobs but the cost of living is climbing quickly. Education, healthcare, and opportunity are sub-par. Persistent cultural and institutional racism, abti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, and sexism limits the opportunity for people here. This drives a lot of my feelings of anxiety for my future."
65,0.18%,"all_R_xbh1HC5qjQS5g77 : Living in the Midwest makes being open about sexuality and gender a bit worse than it would be in other locations, but still better than, say, in the south."

67,0.19%,"all_R_6xwByMsgODSPjbj : Being in the Midwest, there are very few resources in my area for LGBTQ+ people, and I have experienced homophobia in the form of online harassment at my high school."
68,0.68%,"all_R_3KC9Cr2yWZHT2A6 : I feel like Alaska has a somewhat unique social climate. Most people here feel very strongly one way or another about things, and that led to my generation being largely radically leftist. That opened up a lot of potential for accepting friends during my highschool years, which was wonderfully formative. That being said, there are also many individuals on the opposite side of the political spectrum. In my senior year I testified at our city hall in support of an LGBTQIA+ protection ordinance, and it was eye-opening to hear testimonies against-- people who are practically my neighbors that would rather my community be vulnerable in many ways."
69,0.40%,"all_R_1r7eAcSFcxm5EwX : I love in a town with less than 1,000 people. Most are very conservative. I think most people assume that because I'm married that I'm straight. I wouldn't lie about my sexually but I'm not screaming it from the rooftops. I have been trying to relax a little about it though because I have two queer kids and I don't ever want them to feel unsafe or ashamed of anything."
70,0.28%,all_R_tQwC3Q027SDXCy5 : Living in California But it's a fairly conservative area I got to flip off a nazi once which was nice And slightly terrifying and I guess thing I've noticed is people are more comfortable with orientation now than they are with gender presentation.

72,0.35%,"all_R_1K7pXTShU5x84fr : Where I live gender dysphoria and the treatments associated with it are considered ""elective"" which makes paying for them more difficult. The worse my dysphoria gets the worse my depression is, the harder it is to get up everyday. I don't socialize outside of work or family because my dysphoria makes it a nightmare."
73,0.36%,all_R_2zYIUQphxS56xEx : Being transgender is not something talked about or helped with where Iƒ??m from. 1 support group in a maybe 3 county area. Not a lot of jobs with benefits that would help this either. My sort of relationship would be extremely frowned upon if people knew. Iƒ??m not sure if this is what is meant but this is what I came up with.
74,0.41%,"all_R_27BiIY0fNbtfLK6 : Where I live is terrible for transgendered people. I live in small town east texas and I'm constantly worried or fearing for myself. My spouse is very supportive of me as she has been here before the transition. My family is very welcoming and okay with it. But strangers here, not so much. I'm scared to let my b9obs show or that I'll talk to high and be disregarded as a man."
75,0.41%,"all_R_3Gm4ZJGvmwwKflr : My current place of residence gives freedom that was not even possible at my previous place of residence. I feel really at home here for the first time. The anonymity of the big city and the social pressure to perform, as well as the lack of commitment in social encounters, which are typical for my milieu, make it difficult for me to build long-term, deep bonds with others."
76 - 77,0.83%,"all_R_2pPoHDC2r2u4At6 : As an Anatolian Swabian you often have difficulties in the application process. But when it comes to talking, I&amp;#39;ve never received a refusal. However, I had a maximum of 5 interviews for 200 applications. My German fellow students without a migration background were hired more quickly. So I started my own company. Because I donƒ ? ? t want to be judged by people who donƒ ? ? t want to see my qualifications behind my ƒ ? ?outsideƒ ?. Many of my friends in 2nd / 3rd / 4th Generation can share similar experiences. Otherwise I have never experienced racism in Germany until 2012, but since then there have been &amp;quot;racist problems&amp;quot; almost every day. Germany is a very social, innovative, safe and fair country. Without said everyday racism it would still be a dream. :)"
